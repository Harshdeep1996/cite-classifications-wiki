This package contains :class:`.Wikicode` "nodes", which represent a single unit
of wikitext, such as a Template, an HTML tag, a Heading, or plain text. The
node "tree" is far from flat, as most types can contain additional
:class:`.Wikicode` types within them - and with that, more nodes. For example,
the name of a :class:`.Template` is a :class:`.Wikicode` object that can
contain text or more templates.

    :meth:`__unicode__` must be overridden. It should return a ``unicode`` or
    (``str`` in py3k) representation of the node. If the node contains
    :class:`.Wikicode` objects inside of it, :meth:`__children__` should be a
    generator that iterates over them. If the node is printable
    (shown when the page is rendered), :meth:`__strip__` should return its
    printable version, stripping out any formatting marks. It does not have to
    return a string, but something that can be converted to a string with
    ``str()``. Finally, :meth:`__showtree__` can be overridden to build a
    nice tree representation of the node, if desired, for
