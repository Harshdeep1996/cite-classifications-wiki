The second uprising broke out after the collapse of the OSLO agreements, in the early 2002. The Israeli economy was hit twice. It was first hit by the dotcom crash in the US; second, by the 2000-2005 Palestinian . The drastic effects on the Palestinian economy which shortly after split in to two political units (the West bank, controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and the Gaza Strip controlled by Hamas). Especially the Gaza strip economy got down to the level of humanitarian crisis. that the early 2000s shock had relatively small effect on the long-term trajectory of Israel's real GDP. The effect on the Israeli economy of the second Intifada shock was mild, and short-lived. globalization proved to be a \u201cshield\u201d against the Palestinian-Israeli military conflicts and regional trade obstacles for the Israeli economy. This means, that the Israeli economy is exposed, however, to alarming long run risks. If, and when, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the long occupation of the of the West Bank territory would trigger political conflicts between Israel and its trade-and-finance partners, this \u201cshield\u201d, provided by Israel high level of integration with the global economy, may break down.</p>", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.003.0010", "type": "book-chapter", "created":

Second, the book spells out, empirically, how the globalization played a crucial role in advancing Israel's economic progress. That is, economists and policy makers can gain insights as to how a globalized economy takes advantage of international trade, labor mobility, its international financial links, and at the same time push up against globalization headwinds, such as those triggered by the 2008 global financial crisis. A general lesson which comes out is that once a gradual opening up process is set, time-consistent macroeconomic policy is adapted, and well-regulated institutional setup is put in place, Israel\u2019s economy has been able ride on growth-enhancing globalization flows, and weather its chilly storms. The book analyzes these game-changing events, evaluates their role in Israel remarkable development, and compares these developments to groups of developed and emerging- market economies in similar circumstances. To gain broader perspective, the book also looks back into recent history. The unique saga of Israel\u2019s high-inflation crisis and the long period where it rebuilt the major financial, and monetary institutions, and regulatory bodies. These elements provided better macroeconomic stability and help mitigate business cycle fluctuations, and get the economy through military conflicts and boycotts. The book also surveys trending developments that remain challenging. The exceptionally high fertility among ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Arab minority, increasing portions of the population, is the main reason for the flagging labor-force participation. High fertility diminishes skill attainment. A rise in income inequality in all advanced economies, which also takes place in Israel, has a potential for setting off social-political divide. In the case of Israel, its fast development came, however, at the cost of rising income inequality and social polarization. Israel now has the most unequal distribution of income among OECD countries and its public education has declined from one of the best to one of the worst in the OECD. Israel\u2019s income redistributive policies, from rich to poor, from healthy to the sick and from young to old, is significantly less comprehensive in scope, compared to the European systems. It has been becoming even less so over the last decades. Israel has an unusually high fertility rate among the developed economies. The book endeavors to marry economic theory, empirical evidence, and narrative presentation. It does so in a way that is enlightening to the specialist, but remains digestible for the non-professional reader. It provides an opportunity for the reader to look through the rear mirror at the saga of Israel\u2019s high-inflation, and the inflation conquest. To connect to the earlier literature, the book provides a review of books surveys of the earlier phases in the development of the economy of Israel. There could be at least two potential groups of readers: a. Policy makers, academic and non-academic (international institutions, banks, etc.) researchers and students interested in the Israeli Economy; b. Policy makers, academic and non-academic researches, interested in the effects of globalization; and, c. Advanced undergraduate, and graduate students in international macroeconomics courses.</p>", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.001.0001", "type": "monograph", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 24]], "date-time": "2018-09-24T07:50:38Z", "timestamp": 1537775438000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["Israel and the World Economy"], "prefix": "10.7551", "author": [{"given": "Assaf", "family": "Razin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "281", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]]}, "original-title": ["Israel and the World Economy"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 2]], "date-time": "2019-05-02T21:39:41Z", "timestamp": 1556833181000}, "score": 21.961655, "subtitle": ["The Power of Globalization"], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 12]]}, "ISBN": ["9780262037341", "9780262344234"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.001.0001"}], "items-per-page": 20, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}}
