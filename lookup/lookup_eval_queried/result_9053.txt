Probabilistic beliefs can have many traditional epistemic virtues, including factivity, reliability, safety, sensitivity, and aptness. They can also exhibit the same sort of epistemic failure exhibited by justified full beliefs that fail to be knowledge.

A central question of this chapter is why we should think that credences are beliefs in probabilistic contents, as opposed to attitudes of degreed belief in propositions. The answer is that the contents of belief are the objects that play various theoretical roles, such as explaining rational action, grounding relations of disagreement between subjects, and grounding relations of consistency and entailment between beliefs\u2014and probabilistic contents do in fact play each of these roles.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/oso/9780198792154.003.0001", "type": "book",

The idea of universal or guaranteed income proposes that governments provide cash transfers to ensure a livable income to all residents. In effect, this deals with the jobs crisis not by making sure that everyone has a job or by creating more but by making sure everyone does not need to have one. The chapter then argues, first, that by liberating people from the demands of the capitalist employment relationship and the provider\u2013client relationship of certain government programs, UBI inherently advances individual freedom or self-determination. Second, in making space for alternatives, UBI is likely to facilitate relations grounded in solidarity and the mutual benefit of the community. Third, and finally, consequences of UBI may include justice for particular marginalized groups, including those currently on welfare, women, racial minorities, and formerly incarcerated people.</p>",

This article considers the sources of the environmental challenges and the work that has been undertaken to tackle those shared threats. It also considers the region building that has taken place as a result of the cooperation which, although it began as a means of solving the environmental threats but has now spread much further with cohesion and cooperation in many other policy areas. The article concludes with a discussion of how this model could be used as a means of encouraging regional cooperation in other parts of the world, particularly in areas where there is a history of conflict or where there are shared environmental concerns.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1163/22116427_010010008", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 22]], "date-time": "2019-05-22T07:24:56Z", "timestamp": 1558509896000}, "page": "132-157", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Region Building and Regional Cooperation in Response to Environmental Challenges: A Case Study from the Barents Region"], "prefix": "10.1163", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Sarah E.", "family": "Mackie", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "50", "container-title": ["The Yearbook of Polar Law Online"], "link": [{"URL": "https://brill.com/view/journals/yplo/10/1/article-p132_8.xml", "content-type": "text/html", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 28]], "date-time": "2019-05-28T11:01:59Z", "timestamp": 1559041319000}, "score": 18.301504, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22116427_010010008", "ISSN": ["1876-8814", "2211-6427"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2211-6427", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 1]], "date-time": "2019-12-01T14:49:06Z", "timestamp": 1575211746059}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 21]]}, "abstract": "<p>After introducing some basic concepts and definitions, this chapter first discusses the classic conceptions of morality found within the work of important social theorists\u2014focused largely but not fully on sociological scholars.
