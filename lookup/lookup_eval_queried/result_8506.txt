This defect appears to be secondary to a diminished rate of Hageman factor activation, however the abnormality is progressively diminished as the time of incubation of the plasma with appropriate surfaces is increased. Since factor XI and prekallikrein circulate bound to HMW kininogen and HMW kininogen is known to augment the activation of factor XI and prekallikrein by activated Hageman factor, the ability of factor XIA to activate Hageman factor was examined. One ug Hageman factor was bound to supercel alone, or in the presence of 1.5 ug HMW kininogen and 0.1 to 1.0 ug factor XIA for varying time periods (0\u201360 min). The pellet was washed X 3 and bound activated Hageman factor was assayed by its ability to convert prekallikrein to kallikrein. The kallikrein generated was quantified by release of p-nitroaniline from \u03b1-benzoyl phe-val-arg-p-nitroanilide. Factor XIA alone was a weak activator of Hageman factor and the quantity of kallikrein generated was augmented when HMW kininogen was included in the incubation mixture. With limited HMW kininogen the Hageman factor activity appeared proportional to the factor XIA added. The same result was obtained with factor XIA isolated from prekallikrein deficient plasma. The data suggest that factor XIA plus HMW kininogen may represent one of the additional feedback mechanisms by which Hageman factor may be activated and thereby contribute to the gradual activation observed in prekallikrein deficient plasma.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1055/s-0039-1680366", "type": "proceedings-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 13]], "date-time": "2019-05-13T15:28:39Z", "timestamp": 1557761319000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Activation of Hageman Factor by Factor XIA-HMW Kininogen"], "prefix": "10.1055", "author": [{"given": "Henry L.", "family": "Meier", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Russell E.", "family": "Thompson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Allen P.", "family": "Kaplan", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "194", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 16]]}, "event": {"name": "VIth International Congress on Thrombosis and Haemostasis", "location": "Philadelphia", "number": "06", "start": {"date-parts": [[1977, 6, 27]]}, "end": {"date-parts": [[1977, 7, 1]]}}, "container-title": ["VIth International Congress on Thrombosis and Haemostasis"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0039-1680366.pdf", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 6]], "date-time": "2019-12-06T21:49:40Z", "timestamp": 1575668980000}, "score": 25.283306, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1977]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1680366"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 18]], "date-time": "2019-11-18T19:42:56Z", "timestamp": 1574106176323}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Elsevier BV", "issue": "163", "license": [{"URL": "https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[1997, 1, 1]], "date-time": "1997-01-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 852076800000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Biofutur"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1997, 1]]}, "DOI": "10.1016/s0294-3506(97)89244-7", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 26]], "date-time": "2002-07-26T00:07:19Z", "timestamp": 1027642039000}, "page": "44", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Single chain insulin with high bioactivity"], "prefix": "10.1016", "volume": "1997", "author": [{"given": "RE", "family": "Chance", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "78", "container-title": ["Biofutur"], "language": "fr", "link": [{"URL": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0294350697892447?httpAccept=text/xml", "content-type": "text/xml", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0294350697892447?httpAccept=text/plain", "content-type": "text/plain", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 17]], "date-time": "2019-04-17T08:54:06Z", "timestamp": 1555491246000}, "score": 23.926945, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1997, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1997, 1]]}, "issue": "163"}, "alternative-id": ["S0294350697892447"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0294-3506(97)89244-7", "ISSN": ["0294-3506"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0294-3506", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T21:48:49Z", "timestamp": 1574718529212}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Portland Press Ltd.", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": ["portlandpress.com"], "crossmark-restriction": true}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1978, 10, 1]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p>beta-Bungarotoxin was labelled with pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (incorporating 3H).

In the first two groups the correlated responses in crimp abnormality were small and for practical purposes negligible. However. there appeared to be slight increases in crimp abnormality following changes in selection criteria, although this period coincided with adverse seasonal conditions. In the eight pairs of groups selected for single characters, correlated increases in crimp abnormality occurred in the groups selected for high clean wool weight per head, high and low fibre number per unit area of skin, high fibre diameter, and low percentage clean yield, and correlated decreases occurred in the groups selected for low clean wool weight per head, low fibre diameter, and high percentage clean yield. The responses were due mainly to the initial, intense selection of the foundation animals, and the responses to continuing selection were small. Environmental factors (year of fleece growth, maternal handicap, and lambing performance) did not have large effects on crimp abnormality. Crimp abnormality increased with age, and the rate of change was altered by selection in each of the single character groups in which correlated responses in crimp abnormality occurred, the responses being more pronounced at older ages.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9720363", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T20:56:30Z", "timestamp": 1100724990000}, "page": "363", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["Response to selection in Australian Merino sheep.
