He suggested that the anterior and posterior nerve roots have different functions, and based on their connectivity he showed that different parts of the brain have different functions. He noted that individual peripheral nerves actually contain nerve fibers with different functions, that nerves conduct only in one direction, that sense organs are specialized to receive only one form of sensory stimulus, and that there is a sixth (muscle) sense. In addition to the facial palsy and its associated features named after him, he provided the first clinical descriptions of several neurological disorders and important insights into referred pain and reciprocal inhibition. Bell helped to change the way art students are taught, described the anatomical basis of facial expressions, initiated the scientific study of the physical expression of emotions, and stimulated the later work of Charles Darwin on facial expressions. His teachings influenced British and European art. Bell was a renowned medical teacher who founded his own medical school, subsequently took over the famous Hunterian school, and eventually helped establish the University of London and the Middlesex Hospital Medical School in London. However, his belief in intelligent design caused him to be left behind by the evolutionist thought that developed in the nineteenth century.

powerful father, William Cecil Lord Burghley, to his central role in the politics of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean years. It discusses the rivalry between Cecil and the earl of Essex, Elizabeth\u2019s last favourite, and Cecil\u2019s key role in master-minding the smooth accession of James VI of Scotland as King of England in 1603. Created earl of Salisbury, he was the most powerful of James\u2019 ministers, but he struggled to curb the king\u2019s hopeless extravagance and his undue reliance on male favourites. Nevertheless, Salisbury\u2019s premature death in 1612 ended the most constructive period of James\u2019s rule.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199660841.013.4", "type": "book", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 7, 26]], "date-time": "2016-07-26T08:06:32Z", "timestamp": 1469520392000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Robert Cecil and the Transition from Elizabeth to James I"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "Pauline", "family": "Croft", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "286", "container-title": ["Oxford Handbooks Online"], "original-title": ["Robert Cecil and the Transition from Elizabeth to James I"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2016, 7, 29]], "date-time": "2016-07-29T11:02:03Z", "timestamp": 1469790123000}, "score": 19.781528, "editor": [{"given": "Malcolm", "family": "Smuts", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 7, 7]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199660841.013.4"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T11:46:47Z", "timestamp": 1575287207298}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "IEEE", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1978]]}, "DOI": "10.1109/vtc.1978.1622513", "type": "proceedings-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2008, 7, 18]], "date-time": "2008-07-18T15:31:56Z", "timestamp": 1216395116000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Electric vehicles in Bell system"], "prefix": "10.1109", "author": [{"given": "J.", "family": "MacDougall", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "263", "event": {"name": "28th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference", "start": {"date-parts": [[1978, 3, 22]]}, "end": {"date-parts": [[1978, 3, 24]]}}, "container-title": ["28th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference"], "link": [{"URL": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/10797/34040/01622513.pdf?arnumber=1622513", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3, 14]], "date-time": "2017-03-14T18:01:33Z", "timestamp": 1489514493000}, "score": 19.365423, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1978]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/vtc.1978.1622513"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T10:41:54Z", "timestamp": 1574764914367}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "isbn-type": [{"value": "9780199561308", "type": "print"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 5]]}, "DOI": "10.1093/med:psych/9780199561308.003.0011", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 2, 12]], "date-time": "2016-02-12T17:02:08Z", "timestamp": 1455296528000}, "page": "215-232", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Working in multidisciplinary teams"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "Alison J.", "family": "Croft", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Helen", "family": "Close", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "286", "container-title": ["Oxford Guide to Surviving as a CBT Therapist"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10, 4]], "date-time": "2017-10-04T11:55:38Z", "timestamp": 1507118138000}, "score": 19.06333, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 5]]}, "ISBN": ["9780199561308"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/med:psych/9780199561308.003.0011"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T23:02:06Z", "timestamp": 1575500526633}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 1]]}, "abstract": "<p>Two hundred and twenty-five years after 1789, the French Revolution is no longer invoked with great frequency in world politics. Few contemporary moments take its events as a script to follow. Nonetheless, many of its conceptual legacies remain strong. This article traces these legacies in six broad conceptual fields: nationalism, republicanism, human rights, war and peace, political ideology and \u2018revolution\u2019 itself. In each case, it makes clear that the concepts have not been transmitted down to the present unchanged. For instance, the linkage between human rights and citizenship in a particular polity, which the revolutionaries affirmed in their Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, has given way to a widely shared idea that rights act as a limit on sovereign authority. The article closes by observing that the Revolution\u2019s most powerful legacy may be the concept of \u2018revolutionary\u2019 change itself, and its status as a synecdoche for \u2018modernity\u2019 in general.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199639748.013.037", "type": "book", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 8]], "date-time": "2014-07-08T15:14:29Z", "timestamp": 1404832469000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Global Conceptual Legacies"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "David A.", "family": "Bell", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "286", "container-title": ["Oxford Handbooks Online"], "original-title": ["Global Conceptual Legacies"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2016, 12, 6]], "date-time": "2016-12-06T09:09:24Z", "timestamp": 1481015364000}, "score": 19.014734, "editor": [{"given": "David", "family": "Andress", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199639748.013.037"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 19]], "date-time": "2019-11-19T10:36:15Z", "timestamp": 1574159775423}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2004, 9, 23]]}, "DOI": "10.1093/ref:odnb/67533", "type": "reference-book", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 12, 26]], "date-time": "2004-12-26T14:35:27Z", "timestamp": 1104071727000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Bell, Robert (c. 1760\u20131816), lawyer and jurist"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "K.
