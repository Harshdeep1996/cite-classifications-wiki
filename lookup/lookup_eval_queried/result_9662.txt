Depression forces such as they exist in the US, Europe, or Japan, do not appear to hold in the case of Israel. Its resilience to the external financial shock during the global crisis is rooted in (a) the absence of credit boom in the wake of the crisis, and (b) the relatively small commercial banks' exposure in terms of toxic assets that for the European countries played a major role. Reacting to the global trade-diminishing shocks, policy makers\u2019 concern was three-fold: First, banks exposures to toxic assets such as mortgage based securities and foreigners\u2019 debt obligations. Partly because Israel skipped the credit bubble, and bank regulations were relatively tight, Israel showed a sound resilience to the global financial shock. Second, Israel export markets softened and demand conditions deteriorated. Third, Israel domestic currency got strengthened.

Second, the book spells out, empirically, how the globalization played a crucial role in advancing Israel's economic progress. That is, economists and policy makers can gain insights as to how a globalized economy takes advantage of international trade, labor mobility, its international financial links, and at the same time push up against globalization headwinds, such as those triggered by the 2008 global financial crisis. A general lesson which comes out is that once a gradual opening up process is set, time-consistent macroeconomic policy is adapted, and well-regulated institutional setup is put in place, Israel\u2019s economy has been able ride on growth-enhancing globalization flows, and weather its chilly storms. The book analyzes these game-changing events, evaluates their role in Israel remarkable development, and compares these developments to groups of developed and emerging- market economies in similar circumstances. To gain broader perspective, the book also looks back into recent history. The unique saga of Israel\u2019s high-inflation crisis and the long period where it rebuilt the major financial, and monetary institutions, and regulatory bodies. These elements provided better macroeconomic stability and help mitigate business cycle fluctuations, and get the economy through military conflicts and boycotts. The book also surveys trending developments that remain challenging. The exceptionally high fertility among ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Arab minority, increasing portions of the population, is the main reason for the flagging labor-force participation. High fertility diminishes skill attainment. A rise in income inequality in all advanced economies, which also takes place in Israel, has a potential for setting off social-political divide. In the case of Israel, its fast development came, however, at the cost of rising income inequality and social polarization. Israel now has the most unequal distribution of income among OECD countries and its public education has declined from one of the best to one of the worst in the OECD. Israel\u2019s income redistributive policies, from rich to poor, from healthy to the sick and from young to old, is significantly less comprehensive in scope, compared to the European systems. It has been becoming even less so over the last decades. Israel has an unusually high fertility rate among the developed economies. The book endeavors to marry economic theory, empirical evidence, and narrative presentation. It does so in a way that is enlightening to the specialist, but remains digestible for the non-professional reader. It provides an opportunity for the reader to look through the rear mirror at the saga of Israel\u2019s high-inflation, and the inflation conquest. To connect to the earlier literature, the book provides a review of books surveys of the earlier phases in the development of the economy of Israel. There could be at least two potential groups of readers: a. Policy makers, academic and non-academic (international institutions, banks, etc.) researchers and students interested in the Israeli Economy; b. Policy makers, academic and non-academic researches, interested in the effects of globalization; and, c.

little or no math and science beyond primary school (their curriculum focuses almost entirely on religious texts such as the Torah and Talmud). As a result, more than 60 percent live below the poverty line, compared with 12 percent among non-Haredi Jews. Most also opt out of military service, which is compulsory for other Israelis. The net effect: as the Haredi community expands, the burden of both taxation and conscription falls on fewer and fewer Israelis. Trends towards increased fertility, decreased labor force participation, and increased supply of time to religious studies in the ultra-Orthodox community are explained in terms of the behavior of a \u201cclub\u201d that has strengthened its norms of religious stringency in an attempt to brace exclusion. The economic self- preservation of the \u201cclub\u201d is akin to the old age security motive of bringing children, where children is a means for parents from their income (female work income, child allowances, and other government subsidies) generating years to their old age unproductive years. The parents to minimize \u201cdefection\u201d from the community do not endow the children labor- market skills.</p>", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.003.0009", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 24]], "date-time": "2018-09-24T07:50:40Z", "timestamp": 1537775440000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["High Fertility and Anemic Skill Acquisition"], "prefix": "10.7551", "author": [{"given": "Assaf", "family": "Razin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "281", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]]}, "container-title": ["Israel and the World Economy"], "original-title": ["High Fertility and Anemic Skill Acquisition"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 18]], "date-time": "2018-12-18T10:35:08Z", "timestamp": 1545129308000}, "score": 35.334652, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 12]]}, "ISBN": ["9780262037341", "9780262344234"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.003.0009"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T18:52:44Z", "timestamp": 1574880764285}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "The MIT Press", "isbn-type": [{"value": "9780262037341", "type": "print"}, {"value": "9780262344234", "type": "electronic"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 12]]}, "abstract": "<p>Israel's high inflation calamity amounted to a crisis of political and economic institutions. Failing economic governance made it essential for the government to raise revenue through money expansion. At the time when the newly elected government was catering to populistic demands, the printing press was used to finance the fast-expanding government spending and transfers. The central lesson from the Friedman (1971) is that steady-state seigniorage from revenue maximizing central bank is small. However, Israel, as well as previous historical episodes, offer a counter example. Inflation spikes can be a significant source for government revenue. Following almost 8 years of the hyperinflation economic chaos, the Israeli voters brought about some major political rebalancing towards the political center. Sargent (2009) argues that high inflation can be stopped quickly, and at a low cost. His argument is that inflationary expectations are quick to adjust when the economic regime shifts considerably. The temptation not to stop inflation in its tracks may be irresistible. Similarly, if the government surprise market participants by abrupt stopping of hyperinflation in the presence of entrenched inflation expectations, the fiscal burden of public sector wage bill and subsidies to basic food must rise. Therefore, the government may hesitate to do so. To overcome this difficulty there must be a full-fledged social agreement between the government, savers (who hold government bonds), public sector wage earners, and recipients of food subsidies. To fix the inflated outlays on debt service, wage bill, and subsidies, some major redistribution of income must accompany the inflation-halting step. This is in essence the lesson from Israel\u2019s inflation stabilization policy.</p>", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.003.0001", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 24]], "date-time": "2018-09-24T07:50:43Z", "timestamp": 1537775443000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Swell and Retreat of High Inflation"], "prefix": "10.7551", "author": [{"given": "Assaf", "family": "Razin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "281", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]]}, "container-title": ["Israel and the World Economy"], "original-title": ["Swell and Retreat of High Inflation"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 18]], "date-time": "2018-12-18T09:40:28Z", "timestamp": 1545126028000}, "score": 35.334652, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 12]]}, "ISBN": ["9780262037341", "9780262344234"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9780262037341.003.0001"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T18:52:44Z", "timestamp": 1574880764307}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "The MIT Press", "isbn-type": [{"value": "9780262037341", "type": "print"}, {"value": "9780262344234", "type": "electronic"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 12]]}, "abstract": "<p>Because the Soviet-Jews exodus was not foreseen ahead of time, Israel\u2019s migration experience is amenable to the natural-experiment methodology. <italic>Disposable-income inequality in Israel, was roughly stable until the beginning of the 1990s, rose sharply following the immigration wave, even though no such change occurs with respect to the market-generated inequality.</italic> The chapter develops a stylized general equilibrium model with free migration, where wages are endogenous and redistribution policy is determined by (endogenously determined) majority voting.
