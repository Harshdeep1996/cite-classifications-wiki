The increase in total N with the application of farmyard manure, press mud and green manure along with inorganic fertilizer over treatment with inorganic fertilizer alone was 23.1, 34.4 and 7.0%, respectively. These results imply that integrated use of inorganic fertilizers with organic manures represent a sound practice for sustaining N reserves in soil.

The Pharmacia International Metabolic Surveillance (KIMS) study (a pharmacoepidemiological survey of the safety and efficacy of GH replacement in adults, sponsored by Pharmacia) is currently the largest database, with information on over 8000 patients from a total of 27 countries. Abundant epidemiological evidence confirms that hypopituitarism is associated with premature mortality, with an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as a primary underlying cause. Central adiposity, hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus are common in adults with hypopituitarism. GH replacement is associated with improvements in central fat mass and mean reductions in serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol which may be additive to those achieved with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. These beneficial effects are maintained for at least 2 Years after initiation of therapy, as are reductions in central adiposity, with similar benefits seen in men and women when the GH dose is titrated to achieve a serum IGF-I between the median and the upper end of the age-related reference range. Fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin increase, usually within the reference range, during prolonged GH replacement, but do not tend to rise further above baseline in subjects with pre-existing impaired glucose tolerance. Bone remodelling increases during GH replacement therapy, but indices tend to return to baseline within 5 Years of commencing treatment. Bone mineral density increases in men whereas, in women, improvement is limited to stabilisation of bone density. Data from the KIMS study demonstrate that prolonged GH replacement is associated with a reduction in the number of patients requiring assistance with daily living and a significant reduction in sick leave and hospital admissions. GH replacement therapy improves psychological well-being, particularly in those patients with the greatest deficit prior to treatment, with improvement maintained beyond 6 Months of therapy and sustained during long-term follow-up. Data from the KIMS population show that there is no increase in the overall occurrence of de novo neoplasia or the rate of regrowth of primary pituitary tumours. There is an apparent increase in intracranial neoplasia, which may be an artefact of comparing a surveillance population with general population data. Unlike mortality in untreated hypopituitary GH-deficient patients, mortality in the KIMS study is currently similar to that predicted for the normal population.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1530/eje.0.148s009", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2005, 1, 24]], "date-time": "2005-01-24T21:34:41Z", "timestamp": 1106602481000}, "page": "S9-14", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/crossmarkpolicy-1", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 82, "title": ["Long-term experience with GH replacement therapy: efficacy and safety"], "prefix": "10.1530", "author": [{"given": "JP", "family": "Monson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "416", "container-title": ["European Journal of Endocrinology"], "link": [{"URL": "https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/148/Suppl_2/S9.xml", "content-type": "text/html", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 2, 19]], "date-time": "2019-02-19T15:55:32Z", "timestamp": 1550591732000}, "score": 23.561024, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2003, 4, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/eje.0.148s009", "ISSN": ["0804-4643", "1479-683X"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0804-4643", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1479-683X", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 18]], "date-time": "2019-11-18T22:12:13Z", "timestamp": 1574115133691}, "reference-count": 26, "publisher": "Elsevier BV", "issue": "4", "license": [{"URL": "https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[2002, 4, 1]], "date-time": "2002-04-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1017619200000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Journal of Pediatric Surgery"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2002, 4]]}, "DOI": "10.1053/jpsu.2002.31623", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 8, 25]], "date-time": "2002-08-25T03:46:10Z", "timestamp": 1030247170000}, "page": "629-633", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 87, "title": ["Vaginal reconstruction utilizing sigmoid colon: Complications and long-term results"], "prefix": "10.1053", "volume": "37", "author": [{"given": "J.Kellogg", "family": "Parsons", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Susan L.", "family": "Gearhart", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "John P.", "family": "Gearhart", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "78", "container-title": ["Journal of Pediatric Surgery"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022346802540914?httpAccept=text/xml", "content-type": "text/xml", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022346802540914?httpAccept=text/plain", "content-type": "text/plain", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 11]], "date-time": "2019-04-11T22:55:32Z", "timestamp": 1555023332000}, "score": 23.096058, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2002, 4]]}, "references-count": 26, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2002, 4]]}, "issue": "4"}, "alternative-id": ["S0022346802540914"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/jpsu.2002.31623", "ISSN": ["0022-3468"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0022-3468", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T19:42:15Z", "timestamp": 1575488535945}, "reference-count": 1, "publisher": "Wiley", "issue": "9", "license": [{"URL": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1", "start": {"date-parts": [[2015, 9, 1]], "date-time": "2015-09-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1441065600000}, "delay-in-days": 448, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Int J Urol"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 9]]}, "DOI": "10.1111/iju.12493", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 6, 10]], "date-time": "2014-06-10T09:48:07Z", "timestamp": 1402393687000}, "page": "940-940", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editorial Comment to Modified penile disassembly technique for boys with epispadias and those undergoing complete primary repair of exstrophy: Long-term outcomes"], "prefix": "10.1111", "volume": "21", "author": [{"given": "John P", "family": "Gearhart", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Pediatric Urology Division; James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute; Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Charlotte R.

In this study we evaluate the results of long-term clinical outcome in patients who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation of idiopathic fascicular ventricular tachycardia in National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases. Methods: Electrophysiological studies and radiofrequency ablation were performed in 46 consecutive patients (42 men,04 women), age ranging from 16 to 36 years (mean 20\u00b15 years) with verapamilsensitive ILVT and structurally normal hearts. VT could be terminated by the intravenous administration of verapamil in all patients. Mapping was performed using a Bard electrophysiology system. The target site for ablation was the mid-septum of left ventricle where the earliest Purkinje potentials were recorded during VT. RF current was applied to the target site with or without late diastolic potential during VT in all patients to meet the ablation endpoints which were termination of the VT and non-inducibility of the tachycardia. Results: All 46 patients had successful ablation of the ILVT. During 3 years follow up 02 patients had recurrence. Conclusion: Idiopathic left ventricle tachycardia occurs most commonly in young population. Prompt recognition of this arrhythmia is important since radiofrequency ablation can cure this rhythm problem. This can be achieved in a country like Bangladesh where resources are limited. Key words: Radiofrequency Catheter ablation; Idiopathic left ventricle tachycardia.

The experiment was designed to examine the effects of tillage, stubble management, and nitrogen (N) fertiliser on the productivity of a winter cereal-summer fallow cropping system. it commenced in 1968 and the treatments have been maintained until the present. CENTURY operates on a monthly time step, considers all soil N transformations to occur in a single soil layer, and has a very simple crop growth routine that does not deal with crop phenology. APSIM provides a framework whereby a model of a cropping system is configured from component modules, which operate on a daily time step. For simulating the Hermitage experiment, modules to represent the dynamics of soil-water, N, surface residues, and growth of a wheat crop were used. The water and N modules deal with a multi-layered soil, whilst the wheat module develops leaf area, intercepts light, and accumulates and partitions dry matter in response to weather, soil-water, and N. Both models were specified to simulate the whole experimental period (1969-92) as a continuous run. The ability of these models to simulate grain yields, soil-water and drainage, nitrate-N, and soil organic matter were examined. Both models predict, in agreement with the observed data, that for this continuous cereal cropping system there has been a decline in soil organic matter for all the treatments and a reduction through time in the capacity of the soil to mineralise and accumulate nitrate during the fallows. CENTURY performed better than APSIM in predicting the relative yields of the N treatments but was less satisfactory than APSIM for absolute grain yield, soil-water, and drainage. Yield predictions with APSIM were sensitive to carry-over errors in the water balance from one season to the next, so that in some seasons large errors occurred in the predicted relative yields. Both models reproduced the observations well enough to indicate their suitability for providing useful insights into the behaviour of cropping systems where the focus is on depletion of soil fertility.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ea9950941", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2005, 3, 31]], "date-time": "2005-03-31T05:23:10Z", "timestamp": 1112246590000}, "page": "941", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 67, "title": ["Modelling water, nitrogen, and crop yield for a long-term fallow management experiment"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "35", "author": [{"given": "ME", "family": "Probert", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "BA", "family": "Keating", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "JP", "family": "Thompson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "WJ", "family": "Parton", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/EA/pdf/EA9950941", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2018-11-22T03:42:04Z", "timestamp": 1542858124000}, "score": 21.065983, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "issue": "7"}, "alternative-id": ["EA9950941"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ea9950941", "ISSN": ["0816-1089"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0816-1089", "type": "print"}], "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2019-11-21T07:19:49Z", "timestamp": 1574320789828}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Inter-Research Science Center", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Mar.

The average well is deviated from vertical in excess of 50\u00b0 and wells with a maximum deviation in the 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 range are not uncommon before they are dropped off to 50\u00b0 or less when penetrating the completion interval. Over 780 wells have been drilled in this field to date, requiring the highest degree of control and accuracy in order to avoid intersection of other wells and to obtain proper bottom hole spacing. The Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) directional system has been tested on several wells and proven to provide the required accuracy, along with many advantages over past methods, used in the field development.Accurate transmission by MWD of bottom-hole measurements to the surface is provided by mud pressure pulses generated in the drill pipe downhole and detected by a pressure transducer includes the means for detecting, recording and processing these pressure pulses, to translate the information from the pressure pulses to rig floor displays usable by the drilling crew.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/aj80023", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 8, 21]], "date-time": "2017-08-21T23:20:15Z", "timestamp": 1503357615000}, "page": "213", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["FIELD RESULTS USING MEASUREMENT-WHILE-DRILLING DIRECTIONAL SYSTEMS IN LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "21", "author": [{"given": "M.", "family": "Gearhart", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["The APPEA Journal"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2018-11-23T03:29:12Z", "timestamp": 1542943752000}, "score": 20.151052, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1981]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1981]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["AJ80023"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/aj80023", "ISSN": ["1326-4966"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1326-4966", "type": "print"}]}], "items-per-page": 20, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}}
