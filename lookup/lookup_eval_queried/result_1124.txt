When a 3.2-kilobase (kb) PstI fragment of a 29-kb cosmid DNA insert was subcloned into pUC18 at the PstI site downstream of the lacZ promoter, Escherichia coli cells carrying this recombinant plasmid expressed 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase activity. Nucleotide sequencing of the 3.2-kb PstI fragment revealed that there were two open reading frames (ORFI [882 base pairs] and ORFII [834 base pairs], in this gene order). Results of analysis of Tn5 insertion mutants and unidirectional deletion mutants suggested that the ORFI coded for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase. When the sequence of ORFI was compared with that of bphC of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (K. Furukawa, N. Arima, and T. Miyazaki, J. Bacteriol. 169:427-429, 1987), the homology was 68%, with both strains having the same Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The result of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the metabolic product suggested that the ORFII had meta cleavage compound hydrolase activity to produce benzoic acid.

The protein is composed of a 1:1 ratio of a large (alpha) subunit with an estimated molecular weight of 53,300 and a small (beta) subunit with an estimated molecular weight of 27,300. The native molecular weight was 209,000, indicating that the protein adopts an alpha 3 beta 3 native conformation. Measurements of iron and acid-labile sulfide gave 2 mol of each per mol of alpha beta heterodimer. The absorbance spectrum showed peaks at 325 and 450 nm with a broad shoulder at 550 nm. The spectrum was bleached upon reduction of the protein with NADPH in the presence of catalytic amounts of ferredoxinBPH and ferredoxinBPH oxidoreductase. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the reduced protein showed three signals at gx = 1.74, gy = 1.92, and gz = 2.01. These properties are characteristic of proteins that contain a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] center. Biphenyl was oxidized to cis-(2R,3S)-dihydroxy-1-phenylcyclohexa-4,6-diene by ISPBPH in the presence of ferredoxinBPH, ferredoxinBPH oxidoreductase, NADPH, and ferrous iron. Naphthalene was also oxidized to a cis-dihydrodiol, but only 3% was converted to product under the same conditions that gave 92% oxidation of biphenyl. Benzene, toluene, 2,5-dichlorotoluene, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene were not oxidized.

The nonlinear relationship between enzyme activity and protein concentration suggested that the enzyme is composed of multiple protein components. Ion-exchange chromatography of the cell extract gave three protein fractions that were required together to restore enzymatic activity. Similarities with other multicomponent aromatic hydrocarbon dioxygenases indicated that biphenyl dioxygenase may consist of a flavoprotein and iron-sulfur proteins that constitute a short electron transport chain involved in catalyzing the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1128/jb.175.2.395-400.1993", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 11, 7]], "date-time": "2016-11-07T15:22:37Z", "timestamp": 1478532157000}, "page": "395-400", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 31, "title": ["Oxidation of biphenyl by a multicomponent enzyme system from Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400."], "prefix": "10.1128", "volume": "175", "author": [{"given": "J D", "family": "Haddock", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "L M", "family": "Nadim", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "D T", "family": "Gibson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1993, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Journal of Bacteriology"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1128/jb.175.2.395-400.1993", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2016, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2016-12-23T14:28:52Z", "timestamp": 1482503332000}, "score": 26.85759, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1993, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[1993, 1, 1]]}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1993, 1]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.1128/jb.175.2.395-400.1993"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jb.175.2.395-400.1993", "ISSN": ["0021-9193", "1098-5530"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0021-9193", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1098-5530", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T15:58:10Z", "timestamp": 1574524690257}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Informa UK Limited", "issue": "3", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Agricultural and Biological Chemistry"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1986]]}, "DOI": "10.1271/bbb1961.50.681", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 13]], "date-time": "2011-07-13T05:59:26Z", "timestamp": 1310536766000}, "page": "681-686", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 22, "title": ["Microbial degradation products from biphenyl-related compounds."], "prefix": "10.1080", "volume": "50", "author": [{"given": "Ichiro", "family": "TAKASE", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Toshio", "family": "OMORI", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Yasuji", "family": "MINODA", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "301", "container-title": ["Agricultural and Biological Chemistry"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2016, 4, 8]], "date-time": "2016-04-08T15:48:46Z", "timestamp": 1460130526000}, "score": 26.856907, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1986]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1986]]}, "issue": "3"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb1961.50.681", "ISSN": ["0002-1369", "1881-1280"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0002-1369", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1881-1280", "type": "electronic"}]}], "items-per-page": 20, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}}
