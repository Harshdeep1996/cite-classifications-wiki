These calves (either sexes and both local &amp; cross-bred) were brought for treatment at the Bangladesh Agricultural University Veterinary Clinic, Mymensingh during the two years period from June 1999 to May 2001. Of the 100 faecal samples examined, of which 67% calves affected with different parasites and 98% with different bacteria. Of the 67 and 98 calves affected with parasites and bacteria, of which 65.67% and 61.22% had single, 29.85% and 37.76% had dual and only 3.33% and 1.02% had triple concurrent infection, respectively. Analysis of the results of bacterio-parasitic enteropathogens of 100 calves revealed that highest percentage (66%) calves were infected with concurrent parasitic and bacterial infection, followed by 18% with single bacteria, 14% with concurrent bacteria, and only 1% with concurrent parasitic infection but the faecal sample of one diarrhoeic calf showed negative for both bacteria and parasitic infections. Highest rate of gastro-intestinal nematodes (GIN) infection (48%) was recorded in calves, followed by Eimeria spp. (27%), Toxocara vitulorum (14%) and lowest (1%) with each of the Strongyloides, Paramphistomum and Moniezia sp. The clinical T. vitulorum infection was first recorded at the age of 15 days, GIN at 30 days, Strongyloides at 45 days, Paramphistomum at 150 days and Eimeria infection at 25 days. Similarly, the rate of Bacillus infection (87%) was found highest, followed by E. coli\u00c2\u00a0 (37%), Staphylococcus (9 %) and lowest of Salmonella (5%) infection. Although the Bacillus and E. coli recorded first time at the 10 days and Staphylococcus at 30 days age of calves but Salmonella was recorded at the age of 60 days. A characteristic age specific prevalence of both parasite and bacterial enteropathogens was observed. It may be concluded from this study that concurrent infections with parasites or bacteria or both are mainly associated with diarrhea in calves.

All types of these diseases occur t\u00a0 hroughout the world including Bangladesh. The results on the prevalence and effects of zoonotic diseases in humans and animals of Bangladesh are analyzed from the published literatures and presented in this report. It appears from the literature that there are about 1415 human pathogens of which 61% are zoonotic and nearly half of all human pathogens can be classified as emerging, of which 75% of these are caused by zoonotic pathogens. The major zoonotic bacterial diseases recorded in Bangladesh are Anthrax, Tuberculosis, Brucellosis, Salmonellosis, Campylobacteriosis and Leptospirosis, of which only Anthrax has been reported as clinical outbreaks form in both the humans and cattle. During the period 2009 to 2012, anthrax caused death of hundreds of cattle and more than 650 cases of cutaneous anthrax in humans including fatalities in two humans associated with anthrax. The major reported viral zoonotic diseases in Bangladesh include Avian influenza, Rabies, Nipah virus infection, Japanese encephalitis, Rotavirus and Dengue fever. Avian influenza caused by highly pathogenic H5N1 in humans and poultry in Bangladesh and about six humans affected with H5N1 but all of them have recovered. Since 27 March 2007 when Avian influenza was reported to have occurred for the first time in Bangladesh, this virus spread in 51 out of 64 districts with more than 480 outbreaks, culled more than two million poultry birds and cost Tk. 55 billion (US $ 757.9 million) in Bangladesh. Rabies is considered as a priority zoonosis in Bangladesh and it is mainly transmitted to humans and food animals mainly through dog bite nearly 100,000 people and at least 2000 died of rabies in 2009 in Bangladesh. Nipah virus infection is an important emerging infectious disease has been recognized since 2001 in Bangladesh and up to February 2011, 173 humans cases have been identified, of which 110 (63.58%) died. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a vector borne zoonotic disease, first recognized in Bangladesh since an outbreak in 1977 and 12.38% encephalitis patients had JE virus infection which was associated with mortality, physical disability and cognitive difficulties. Rotavirus is a worldwide distributed zoonotic disease affecting mammals and birds and it has been reported from Bangladesh in humans (23.75%), animals (12 to 43.78%) and broiler birds (13.15%) associated with diarrheic syndrome. Dengue fever was first reported in Bangladesh in 1964 and outbreak that began in 2000 predominantly caused by DENV-3 in which 5551 cases recovered and 93 Dengue related deaths were reported. The dermatomycosis has been reported in 9.3% cattle, 18.6% goats and 25.2% in contact humans. The major zoonotic parasites recorded in cats in Bangladesh include Paragonimus westermani (9.09%), Ancyclostoma tubaeforme (36.36%), Dirofilaria immitis (9.09%), Toxocara cati (45.45%) and Toxoplasma gondii (9.09%), in dogs include Diphyllobothrium latum (13.3%), Diphylidium caninum (16.69%), Echinococcus granulosus (9.17%), Ancylostomum caninum (9-100%), Gnathostoma spingerum (40.0%), Toxocara canis (23.3%), Trichuris vulpis (13.8%) and in pigs include Entaemebea histolytica (17.24%) and Balantidium coli (60.34%). The prevalence of zoonotic protozoan diseases recorded in humans in Bangladesh include amebiasis (E. histolytica 4.71% &amp; E. dispar 12.6%), giardiasis (21% in children &amp; 51% in malnourished children), cryptosporidiasis (1.4 to 3.5% in diarrheic patients) and visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) which was first reported in Jassore in 1824 but still sporadic outbreaks are occurring in the different districts in Bangladesh. Sero-surveillance studies showed 16 to 17% cattle, 17.65 to 53.6% sheep, 12.09 to 35.4% goats and 15.89% women had T. gondii antibodies in Bangladesh. It appears from these results that all types of emerging, reemerging and neglected zoonotic diseases are widely prevalent and pose a great threat to human health in Bangladesh. Neglected Veterinary medical profession and its extension services, poor people without any knowledge of zoonotic diseases who are in close contact with livestock and their products, and unhygienic processing, maintaining and marketing the livestock and livestock products have made the situation graver in Bangladesh.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjvm.v9i2.13451</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/bjvm.v9i2.13451", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 5, 29]], "date-time": "2013-05-29T02:45:49Z", "timestamp": 1369795549000}, "page": "95-120", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT CAUSED BY ZOONOTIC DISEASES IN BANGLADESH"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "MA", "family": "Samad", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 22]]}, "container-title": ["Bangladesh Journal of Veterinary Medicine"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJVM/article/download/13451/10733", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJVM/article/download/13451/10733", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 1]], "date-time": "2019-01-01T15:49:32Z", "timestamp": 1546357772000}, "score": 30.487816, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 22]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjvm.v9i2.13451", "ISSN": ["2308-0922", "1729-7893"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1729-7893", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2308-0922", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2019-11-21T02:30:49Z", "timestamp": 1574303449908}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Bangladesh Journals Online (JOL)", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Bangl.

These included omphalitis (5.25%), enteritis (9.08%), pneumonia (0.80%), egg peritonitis (2.74%), egg bound (8.28%), salpingitis (0.40%), malabsorption syndrome (0.17%), ascites (0.74%), visceral gout (0.86%), neoplastic disease (1.54%), hydropericardium-hepatitis syndrome (0.23%), big liver and spleen disease (0.06%), fatty liver-haemorrhagic syndrome (0.80%) and cannibalism (0.17%). The possible etiology, single and concurrent occurrences influence of age and seasons on the occurrence of these disorders are described and discussed. It may be concluded from this study that the systemic and miscellaneous disorders are associated in the high rate of morbidity and mortality in commercial poultry with possible complex etiology.

This study was carried out to determine the role of single and concurrent infections associated with mortality in 1751 commercial chickens during one year period from January to December 2002. Diagnosis of diseases was made on the basis of history, necropsy findings, isolation and identification of causative bacteria and other laboratory tests. The etiological investigations of 1751 dead chickens showed that about 39.81% bacterial, 22.73% viral, 13.65% mycoplasmal, 1.54% fungal, 10.11% parasitic, 31.64% systemic, 3.43% nutritional deficiency and 1.77% other diseases were associated with these mortality. Salmonellosis (21.99%), Colibacillosis (8.40%), Fowl cholera (6.52%), Avian mycoplasmosis (13.65%), Infectious bursal disease (11.20%), Newcastle disease (10.34%) and coccidiosis (6.23%) were recognized as major diseases associated with mortality in commercial chickens in Bangladesh. About 32 diseases were recorded, of which both single (76.30%) and mixed infections as two (21.53%), three (1.83%) and four (0.34%) types were associated with mortality of chickens. Significantly (p &lt; 0.01) highest proportionate mortality rate was recorded in &gt; 20 weeks old adult layer (45.52%) in comparison to &gt; 2 to 8 weeks old grower (24.04%), &gt; 8 to 20 weeks old pullet (18.16%) and up to 2 weeks old brooding (12.28%) chickens. Seasonal influence showed highest mortality rate during Summer (43.06%) in comparison to Rainy (27.81%) and Winter (29.13%) seasons. It may be concluded from this study that both the single and concurrent infections are associated with high mortality rate in commercial chickens in Bangladesh. Therefore, the interactions of different pathogens in naturally occurring diseases should be considered during diagnosis and evaluation of vaccination.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Key words: Occurrence; concurrent; mortality; diseases; chickens DOI = 10.3329/bjvm.v1i1.1911 Bangl.

Age-wise occurrence of IBD showed highest infection rate in growing stage (82.65%) in comparison to brooding (3.06%), pullet (6.12%) and adult layer (8.16%) chickens. Although more or less all age groups of chickens were affected by ND (1.66% to 50.83%) but it was found significantly (p &lt; 0.01) highest in adult (50.83%) chickens. Infectious bronchitis was recorded only in adult chickens. Avian leukosis was found higher in pullet (66.67%) than the adult (33.33%) layer birds. Fowl pox also recorded only in pullet stage of chickens. Seasonal influence showed significantly (p &lt; 0.01) highest occurrence of IBD during summer (44.39%) in comparison to rainy (30.61%) and winter (25.00%) seasons. Similarly ND was recorded more or less uniformly in all the three seasons of the year with significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher rate during summer (41.99%) season. Infectious bronchitis was recorded significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in summer (63.66%) season while avian leukosis was recorded in winter (66.67%). Fowl pox was found equally in winter and summer seasons (50%). Although IBD was found with other concurrent infection e.g., dual (23.98%) and triple (2.55%) types of infection but highest occurrence was recorded as a single type (73.47%) of infection. ND was found with dual (44.75%), triple (7.18%) and fourth (1.10%) types of infection but specially single infection (46.96%) were associated with high mortality.

Of the 87 RCC aged between 1 to 96 months which included 22 milch cows, 15 pregnant cows, 8 dry cows, 18 weaned calves and 24 unweaned calves. Parasitological examination of faecal samples of all the selected 87 RCC showed that 51.72% (n = 45) animals affected with different types of gastro-intestinal parasites, of which 37.93% had single, 12.64% had dual and only 1.15% animals had triple types of infection. An overall 34.48% paramphistomiasis, 25.29% balantidiasis, 2.30% toxocariasis, 2.30% strongyloidiasis, 1.15% trichuriasis and 1.15% fascioliasis was recorded in RCC. However, toxocariasis (18.75%), strongyloidiasis (18.75%) and trichuriasis (6.25%) were recorded in calves up to 6 months old, and paramphistomiasis (34.48%) and fascioliasis (1.15%) in cattle more than 6 months of age whereas balantidiasis (25.29%) was recorded in all age groups of cattle. The anthelmintic efficacy of the combined commercial preparations with Tetramisole hydrochloride 2.0g and Oxyclozanide 1.4g per bolus (Levanid\u00ae, Acme ; Tetranid\u00ae, Techno Drugs) @ 1 bolus / 100 kg body weight with a single oral dose caused 100% reduction of faecal egg count at day 7 post-treatment. A single oral dose of 1% copper sulfate solution @ 10 ml / kg and metranidazole (Flagyl\u00ae, Aventis) @ 4 mg /kg body weight resulted 100% and 42.85% reduction of Balantidium coli trophozoites, respectively. The average milk production records of RCC affected with gastro-intestinal parasitosis (1.41litre / day / animal) were compared with the mean milk production records at day 7 post-anthelmintic treatment (1.73 liter / day / animal) and results showed an average increased milk yield +0.32 litre / day / animal. This study indicates that RCC affected with sub-clinical gastro-intestinal parasitosis caused ill-health and decrease milk yield like zebu and cross-bred cattle. It may be concluded from this study that the RCC should be regularly monitored through faecal examination for the presence of gastro-intestinal parasites in order to provide rational treatment and control management to make the RCC farming profitable.\u00a0DOI = 10.3329/bjvm.v8i1.7395 Bangl.

This communication report the outbreaks of IBD on two vaccinated (Gumboro D78\u00c2\u00ae, Intervet) and one unvaccinated commercial cockerel farms which were diagnosed on clinico-pathological findings and assessment of ELISA antibody titre. The outbreaks of IBD occurred on two vaccinated farms in cockerels of 29 to 31 days (Farm 1) and 30 to 33 days (Farm 2), whereas 19 to 22 days old in unvaccinated (Farm 3) birds. It caused 39.38% (Farm 1) and 75.0% (Farm 2) mortality in vaccinated and 29.20% (Farm 3) in unvaccinated cockerel farms. Clinical investigation showed rapid onset, dullness, depression, anorexia, whitish loose diarrhoea, soiling and pasting of the vent, ruffled feathers, trembling and finally prostration and death due to dehydration. Necropsy examination revealed dehydrated carcasses, enlargement and oedematous swelling of bursa Fabricius and some cases yellowish, haemorrhagic, yellowish and caseous exudate in the bursa. Skeletal muscles especially thigh muscles showed haemorrhages in some birds. The IBD ELISA antibody titre of both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated moribund cockerels showed at vulnerable state and the mean antibody titre of vaccinated farm 1 had 161 \u00c2\u00b1 59.22 and vaccinated farm 2 had 57.82 \u00c2\u00b1 14.85, whereas unvaccinated farms had 194 \u00c2\u00b1 90.35. The occurrence of IBD outbreaks in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated birds indicate not only vaccination failure but also defective control strategies, which resulted heavy economic loss (85.05%) in the three cockerel farms.

This study used a commercial immunochromatographic assay (ICGA) to detect the prevalence of bTB and to evaluate the differences in milk production between lactating cows with positive and negative results in Bangladesh. Thirty Red Chittagong (indigenous) cattle (RCC) were randomly selected from a herd of 87 RCC maintained at the Bangladesh Agricultural University Dairy Farm (BAUDF), Mymensingh during the period from March to July 2008, of which 30% cattle showed positive reaction to bTB. Of the 30 tested cattle, 35.29% (6/17) lactating cows, 20.0% (1/5) non-lactating pregnant cows, 33.33% (1/3) weaned calves and 20.0% (1/5) unweaned calves showed positive reaction to bTB. The detection of bTB in two calves and their respective mother cows indicates the possible transmission of TB organism through their colostrums / milk. Of the 17 lactating cows, 6 cows had positive and 11 had negative results to bTB. Cows with positive results produced less milk ( mean 1.29 litre / day / cow ) in comparison to cows with negative test ( mean 1.57 litre / day/ cow ) results which appeared as 17.83% reduction of milk production. Further study on the mastitis with or without bTB and its effect on milk production require data of more herds for conclusion of these results.

Out of the 116 lactating cows examined, 51 (43.97%) showed positive reactivity to CMT. Similar prevalence rate of SCM was recorded in both the HFCC (43.75%) and RCC (45.0%). The overall prevalence of SCM on the basis of lactation stages showed that all the three lactation stages had SCM but there was a tendency to increase its prevalence rates from early (30.43%), mid (32.26%) to late (69.23%) stages. The highest prevalence of SCM was recorded at late lactation stage in both the HFCC (68.75%) and RCC (71.43%) in comparison to their respective mid and early lactation stages. The parity-wise prevalence of SCM was recorded as 18.42%, 55.0%, 66.67%, 75.0% and 75.0% in HFCC whereas, it was 20.0%, 20.0%, 66.67%, 75.0% and 66.67% in RCC at their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th parity, respectively. This study recorded a relationship between the increased prevalence of SCM with decreased of milk production in both the groups of lactating cows. The respective prevalence of SCM at high, medium and low level of milk production in HFC (14.29%, 33.33% and 70.59%) and RCC (14.29%, 50.00% and 71.42%) were found significantly (p &lt; 0.01) correlated with milk production. An overall 19.18% quarters was affected with SCM, of which 4.31%, 7.33% and 7.38% showed mild, moderate and severe reaction to CMT. However, comparatively, higher percentage of quarter infection was recorded in HFCC (20.31%) than RCC (13.75%). It may be concluded from these observations that both the HFCC and RCC should be monitored by using CMT for the detection of SCM in order to provide rational treatment and control it to make the dairy farming profitable.\u00a0DOI = 10.3329/bjvm.v8i1.7397 Bangl.

This has been done under the simultaneous action of suction, radiation, uniform transverse magnetic field, heat generation and viscous dissipation. The stretching sheet is assumed to continuously moving with a power-law velocity and maintaining a uniform surface heat flux. The governing nonlinear partial differential equations are transformed into a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using appropriate similarity transfor-mations. The resulting dimensionless equations are solved numerically using sixth order Runge-Kutta integration scheme with Nachtsheim-Swigert shooting iterative technique. A systematical study of numerical results for the non-dimensional velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are presented graphically. Due to physical and engineering interest, the viscous drag or local Skin-friction coefficient, heat transfer rate or local Nusselt number and mass transfer rate or local Sherwood number are represented in tabular form to illustrate the details of flow characteristics and their dependence on all physically important parameters of different non-Newtonian fluids. A comparison of the present study and previously published paper has also been shown in tabular form.Bangladesh J. Sci.

Dairy animals including lactating goats are prone to the intramammary infection (IMI) and associated with a lot of economic impact on the farmers but the reports on caprine mastitis are very limited in inland literature. This study was undertaken to determine the udder-halve-wise comparative prevalence of clinical and sub-clinical caprine mastitis with their associated bacterial pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity patterns during the period from January to May 2010. The teat and udder of a lactating population of 1025 Black Bengal goats maintained under rural (village) condition in two different districts (Joypurhat and Mymensingh) of Bangladesh were physically examined, of which 54 (5.27%) goats had clinical mastitis which constituted as experimental animals for this study. Of the 54 selected goats, 59 (54.63%) udder-halves were affected with clinical mastitis whereas the remaining 49 (45.37%) udder-halves of the selected goats were found physically normal. Out of 59 udder-halves, 49 (90.74%) were unilaterally and 5 (9.26%) were bilaterally affected with clinical mastitis. The prevalence of clinical mastitis was found significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in left udder-haves (H = 47; 79.66%) in comparison to the right (H = 12; 20.34%) udder-halves. Milk samples collected from all the 108 udder-halves were examined bacteriologically, of which 102 (94.44%) udder-halves had bacterial infection. No significant differences was observed on the status of bacterial pathogens between clinically (H = 55; 93.22%) and sub-clinically (H = 47; 95.92%) affected udder-halves, and between the single (CH = 45; 76.27% and SCH = 35; 71.43%) and mixed (CH = 10; 16.95% and SCH = 12; 24.49%) bacterial infections in both the clinical and sub-clinical mastitis udder-halves. The major bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus spp. which showed to be highest frequency (38.98%), followed by Escherichia coli (27.12%) and Bacillus spp. (10.17%) as a single clinical IMI whereas mixed IMI were also detected in both clinically and sub-clinically affected udder-halves. Antibiotic sensitivity results showed a relatively high level of resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and streptomycin, whereas gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were found to be the most effective drugs. These results indicate the high prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis in apparently normal quarters of lactating goats than those had clinical mastitis in other udder-halves, and therefore, there is a need for the prudent use of antibacterial in animal health and production through bacteriological and antibiogram studies in Bangladesh.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjvm.v9i2.13456</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/bjvm.v9i2.13456", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 5, 29]], "date-time": "2013-05-29T02:45:49Z", "timestamp": 1369795549000}, "page": "137-143", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["UDDER-HALVE-WISE COMPARATIVE PREVALENCE OF CLINICAL AND SUB-CLINICAL MASTITIS IN LACTATING GOATS WITH THEIR BACTERIAL PATHOGENS AND ANTIBIOTIC SENSITIVITY PATTERNS IN BANGLADESH"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "H", "family": "Sarker", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MA", "family": "Samad", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 22]]}, "container-title": ["Bangladesh Journal of Veterinary Medicine"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJVM/article/download/13456/9691", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJVM/article/download/13456/9691", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 1]], "date-time": "2019-01-01T15:50:17Z", "timestamp": 1546357817000}, "score": 26.997398, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 22]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjvm.v9i2.13456", "ISSN": ["2308-0922", "1729-7893"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1729-7893", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2308-0922", "type": "electronic"}]}], "items-per-page": 20, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}}
