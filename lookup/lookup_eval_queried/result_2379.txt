The total prevalence of rotavirus infection in broiler chickens was in Gazipur 2.43% and 0% in Mymensingh.

Some of the highest incidences are seen in the Indian subcontinent, southern France, and South America.

Fifty adult patients presenting with haematemesis and or melaena admitted consecutively into medical units were evaluated through proper history taking, thorough clinical examination, endoscopic examination within 48 hours of first presentation and other related investigations. Patients who were not stabilized haemodynamically within 48 hours of resuscitation and endoscopy could not be done within that period were excluded from this study. Out of 50 patients 44 were male and 6 were female and average age of the patients was 39.9 years. Most of the patients belonged to low socio-economic condition- Farmers (22%), Service holder (18%), Laborers (l6%), Students (l4%), Businessman (8%), House wife (4%) and others (l8%). Farmers, service holders and laborers were the most affected group (57%). Among the patients monthly income (Tk) was &gt; 20000/= (2%), 15000-20000/= (8%), 8000-15000 /= (10%) and 0-8000/= (80%). Haematemesis and melaena (42%), melaena (42%), Haematemesis (16%) were the presenting features. Endoscopy revealed that duodenal ulcer (34%) was the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding followed by rupture of portal varices (16%), neoplasm (10%), gastric ulcer (08%) and gastric erosion ( 06%). Peptic ulcer disease still remains as the major cause of upper (GI) haemorrhage though cases of ruptured oesophageal varices are gradually increasing.

It appears from the different reports that with the recommendation of the Joint Indo-American and Pak-American teams on agricultural research and education recommended to establish Agricultural Universities in India and Pakistan where veterinary and agriculture education brought under one umbrella with bifurcation of the complete degree, B.Sc. (Vet. Sci. &amp; AH) into two, DVM (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine) and B.Sc. (AH) as an American education pattern of Land Grant colleges. Out of 22 Veterinary colleges of India, only three Agricultural Universities ( Pantnagar, Haryana and Punjab ) and two in Pakistan (EPAU and WPAU) were implemented the American recommendations. The Indian National Commission on Agriculture has recognized these two separate degrees offered in a profession as detrimental towards livestock development and the Review Committee on Agricultural Universities who recommended an integration of the two degrees to avoid duplication. Accordingly, these two degrees in all the three Indian universities have been combined as BVSc &amp; AH in 1982, and as DVM in 2002 in Pakistan, whereas the Veterinary education has made more complex in Bangladesh through establishment of four Government Veterinary Colleges where offering five years DVM degree including one year internship with combined curricula on animal health and production against four years separate two degrees offering from BAU without internship. Veterinary education should include animal health, animal production and animal product technology for effective teaching, research and extension programme and accordingly, the curricula and syllabi of all the Veterinary degrees offering all over the world have been adjusted except BAU which is urgently required to adjust and reformulate the uniform curricula and syllabi in all the degree offering educational institutes in Bangladesh. Moreover, the history of modern veterinary education in India showed great achievement through establishment of Veterinary University, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences  University' on September 1989. Therefore, there is a strong urge to establish Veterinary University in Bangladesh following the pattern of India. DOI:10.3329/bjvm.v1i1.1909  Bangl. J. Vet. Med.

Genotyping was done using the extracted genomic DNA from 90 TB patients followed by amplification of target alleles by PCR. Amplified alleles were then digested by restriction enzymes followed by gel electrophoresis &amp; sequencing to identify the targeted alleles namely CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*2, CYP3A4*4, CY3A4*5, CYP3A4*6, CYP3A4*10, CYP3A4*18, and CYP3A5*3. In TB patients, no samples were positive for CYP3A4*2, CYP3A4*4, CYP3A4*5, CYP3A4*6, CYP3A4*10, and CYP3A4*18 alleles. One sample was found to be heterozygous for CYP3A4*1B (1.11%). The wild homozygous (CYP3A5*1/*1) genotype frequency was 7.78%, the heterozygous (CYP3A5*1/*3) frequency was 42.22% and the homozygous mutant (CYP3A5*3/*3) frequency was 50% in Bangladeshi TB patients. The absence of the common polymorphic gene suggests that there will be no impact of CYP3A drug metabolizing enzymes on antituberculosis drugs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bmrcb.v38i1.6978Bangladesh Med Res Counc Bull 2012; 38: 1-5</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/bmrcb.v38i1.6978", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 4, 22]], "date-time": "2012-04-22T15:43:09Z", "timestamp": 1335109389000}, "page": "1-5", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["CYP3A Genotypes in Bangladeshi Tuberculosis Patients"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "38", "author": [{"given": "AA", "family": "Maruf", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MU", "family": "Ahmed", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "M.A.K.", "family": "Azad", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "M", "family": "Ahmed", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "A", "family": "Hasnat", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 4, 22]]}, "container-title": ["Bangladesh Medical Research Council Bulletin"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BMRCB/article/download/6978/7728", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BMRCB/article/download/6978/7728", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 1]], "date-time": "2019-01-01T21:31:24Z", "timestamp": 1546378284000}, "score": 24.061438, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 4, 22]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 4, 22]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bmrcb.v38i1.6978", "ISSN": ["2224-7238", "0377-9238"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0377-9238", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2224-7238", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T20:49:04Z", "timestamp": 1574455744369}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Bangladesh Journals Online (JOL)", "issue": "4", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Bangladesh J.

Significant differences were found among the genotypes for the characters studied. Ear length and grain yield (t/ha) had moderate genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) and phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV), but the had the low environmental co-efficient of variation (ECV). The heritability for all the characters was high. The characters viz. plant height, ear height and 1000-grain weight, showed high heritability along with high genetic advance. Ear length, ear diameter and kernel per row had highly significant positive correlation with grain yield. However, the deviations between genotypic and phenotypic correlation and magnitude of environmental correlation suggested considerable influence of growing environment in expressing almost all the characters. Path coefficient analysis revealed that plant height (0.659), ear length (0.934) and kernel-rows per ear (0.715) had highly significant positive direct effect on grain yield suggesting their importance during selection. Simultaneous restricted selection should be done for number of kernel rows per ear.Bangladesh J. Agril.

Despite the benign nature of the disease, RAU frequently affects quality of life as a result of long lasting and recurrent episodes of burning pain.Aim and objective: the aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of colchicine in treatment of recurrent oral aphthous ulcer.Methods: A clinical trial was conducted among 30 samples in the department of dermatology and venereology of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka. Study was performed among those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Data was collected from 1st September 2007 to 29th February. 2008 and enrolled data was analyzed by using statistical SPSS win 13.Results: Among 30 patients, 24 (80%) were male and 6(20%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 26.20 (\u00b16.65) years. 26(87.7%) patients found ulcer in oral mucosa and 4(13.3%)in tongue, but previous family history was present in only 20% cases out of 30 patients. All patients experienced a marked decrease in symptoms during colchicine treatment in where; mean aphthae count was 3.27 (\u00b11.05) before treatment and 0.43 (\u00b10.68) during treatment.

Such information are necessary for assessing the impact of surgical conditions, both elective and emergency, on the health of UN peacekeepers from different races and nationalities and for setting priority to improve the surgical care. Objectives: To ascertain highest possible standard of surgical care to be ensured in an international arena for optimal outcome. Materials and methods: Five years retrospective study was carried out in Bangladesh level II hospital (BANMED), UNMIL located at Suakoko district of Liberia from April 2007 to April 2012 comprising of all major and minor surgical cases with different types of dressings done. Results: A total 83 major, 567 minor and 3924 dressings were done. The majority of operations were emergency cases of which 73.49% were of major and 78.30% were minor surgery. While 26.50% of major and 21.69% of minor surgery were elective cases. All were male patients in cases of major operations and 93.29% for minor cases as most of the peacekeepers were male personnel. The most frequent cases were acute appendicitis, inguinal hernia and polytrauma cases. Highest number of patients was 28 (33.73%) from 26-30 years age group. There were 3 minor postoperative complications with nil mortality rates. Conclusion: The surgical unit of a level-II hospital has to work in an adverse situation of a conflict area with various limitations. So it is very important to provide highest possible standard of surgical care to be ensured in terms of staff, equipments, logistic support and with a motivated surgical team in an international arena for optimal outcome.

The antigenic studies with reference to subgroups and serotypes specificity and its zoonotic potential needs to be studied further.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/bjvm.v7i2.5997", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 11, 4]], "date-time": "2011-11-04T09:49:07Z", "timestamp": 1320400147000}, "page": "314-319", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["ROTAVIRUS INFECTION IN HUMAN AND BIRDS"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "MS", "family": "Islam", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MM", "family": "Alam", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MM", "family": "Rahman", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MU", "family": "Ahmed", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Bangladesh Journal of Veterinary Medicine"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJVM/article/download/5997/4698", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJVM/article/download/5997/4698", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 1]], "date-time": "2019-01-01T15:51:13Z", "timestamp": 1546357873000}, "score": 22.490982, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 9, 3]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjvm.v7i2.5997", "ISSN": ["2308-0922", "1729-7893"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1729-7893", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2308-0922", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T20:28:34Z", "timestamp": 1574800114280}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Bangladesh Journals Online (JOL)", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2017, 6, 25]], "date-time": "2017-06-25T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1498348800000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Bangladesh J.

Pollen morphology was examined by Light Microscope (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The systematic study of these species was conducted by means of numerical analysis using UPGMA clustering and PCO analysis based on 33 morphological characters, including life form, vegetative parts, fruits, floral characters, seeds and pollen grains. Pollen grains were found to be monads, radially symmetrical, isopolar, small-sized and homocolpate. Tamarix nilotica can be easily separated from other taxa by its subprolate pollen shape. Two major clades were identified by multivariate analysis of morphological characters; one of them included three species, namely T. amplexicaulis, T. passerinoides and T. macrocarpa. Our results indicate that there is a wide range of morphological similarity among the species of section Polyadenia. The other clade included T. aphylla, T. tetragyna and T. nilotica from section Tamarix and section Oligadenia.Keywords: Tamarix; Pollen Morphology; Numerical Taxonomy; UPGMA Cluster; PCO, Egypt.Bangladesh J.
