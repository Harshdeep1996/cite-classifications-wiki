Recently, it has become apparent from both animal and human studies that growth factors within the maternal circulation, for example the IGFs, are important regulators of placental development and function. Although these factors act via distinct receptors to exert their effects, the downstream molecules activated upon ligand/receptor interaction are common to many growth factors. The expression of numerous signaling molecules is altered in the placentas from pregnancies affected by the fetal growth complications, fetal growth restriction, and macrosomia. Thus, targeting these molecules may lead to more effective treatments for complications of pregnancy associated with altered placental development.

Water stress reduces the photosynthetic input, reducing both leaf area and photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area. Respiratory losses are reduced more or less proportionately. A less-than-proportional loss was observed during osmotic adjustment in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench): the metabolic cost of storing photosynthate and using it for osmotic adjustment was less than the cost of converting it to new biomass. A slightly increased metabolic cost is often found under salt stress but, in sorghum plants that were salinized and then water stressed, the adverse effects of salt were mitigated by decreased water loss rates and enhanced osmotic adjustment during water stress. More tests involving combined salt and water stress are needed.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/pp9860033", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2006, 1, 4]], "date-time": "2006-01-04T01:13:23Z", "timestamp": 1136337203000}, "page": "33", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 65, "title": ["Whole-Plant Carbon Balance During Osmotic Adjustment to Drought and Salinity Stress"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "13", "author": [{"given": "KJ", "family": "Mccree", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Functional Plant Biology"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/pdf/PP9860033", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2018-11-23T01:46:39Z", "timestamp": 1542937599000}, "score": 21.546064, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1986]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1986]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["PP9860033"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/pp9860033", "ISSN": ["1445-4408"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1445-4408", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T07:47:02Z", "timestamp": 1575272822085}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Society for Neuroscience", "issue": "8", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["J.

Degenerate oligonucleotides to both of these amino acid sequences were designed and used in reverse transcriptase PCR with RNA from lactating porcine mammary gland as a template. A 162 bp PCR fragment was detected and sequenced. Compilation of the deduced and determined amino acid sequence revealed a protein of 111 amino acids, which had approximately 75, 50, 40 and 35% similarity at amino acid level to camel, rabbit, rat and mouse WAP respectively. It also included the four-disulphide core characteristic of all WAP proteins and most Kunitz-type protease inhibitors. This provides the first unequivocal evidence for WAP secretion in the pig. SDS PAGE analysis of the whey fraction showed that WAP is secreted as a major protein in sow's milk from farrowing to weaning. The molecular mass of WAP in SDS PAGE was significantly greater than the 11.7 kDa determined from amino acid sequence, indicating that porcine WAP is possibly glycosylated. Northern analysis detected a single mRNA transcript of approximately 600 bp in porcine RNA from the mammary gland of lactating sows. To examine the hormone-regulated expression of the WAP gene the mammary glands of sows at day 90 of pregnancy were biopsied and explants cultured for 3 days in the presence of various combinations of porcine insulin (I), cortisol (F) and porcine prolactin (P). Northern analysis of RNA extracted from the tissue indicated that WAP gene expression was barely detectable in the mammary gland prior to culture and there was no increment in explants cultured in the presence of I and F. However, a significant increase in the accumulation of WAP mRNA was observed in explants cultured in I, F and P. A similar result was observed for beta-casein and alpha-lactalbumin gene expression.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1677/jme.0.0200027", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2004-12-02T23:43:59Z", "timestamp": 1102031039000}, "page": "27-35", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/crossmarkpolicy-1", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 44, "title": ["Molecular characterisation and hormone-dependent expression of the porcine whey acidic protein gene"], "prefix": "10.1530", "author": [{"given": "KJ", "family": "Simpson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "P", "family": "Bird", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "D", "family": "Shaw", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "K", "family": "Nicholas", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "416", "container-title": ["Journal of Molecular Endocrinology"], "link": [{"URL": "https://jme.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/jme/20/1/27.xml", "content-type": "text/html", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 2, 15]], "date-time": "2019-02-15T13:42:50Z", "timestamp": 1550238170000}, "score": 20.327942, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1998, 2, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1677/jme.0.0200027", "ISSN": ["0952-5041", "1479-6813"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0952-5041", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1479-6813", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T23:51:03Z", "timestamp": 1574553063750}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Wiley", "issue": "12", "license": [{"URL": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1", "start": {"date-parts": [[2015, 9, 1]], "date-time": "2015-09-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1441065600000}, "delay-in-days": 321, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["BJOG: Int J Obstet Gy"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 11]]}, "DOI": "10.1111/1471-0528.13097", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 15]], "date-time": "2014-10-15T06:07:13Z", "timestamp": 1413353233000}, "page": "1687-1687", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Selected use of antenatal Rhesus-immune globulin based on free fetal DNA"], "prefix": "10.1111", "volume": "122", "author": [{"given": "KJ", "family": "Moise", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "The University of Texas Medical School at Houston; Houston TX USA"}]}], "member": "311", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 15]]}, "container-title": ["BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2F1471-0528.13097", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3, 27]], "date-time": "2017-03-27T23:44:43Z", "timestamp": 1490658283000}, "score": 19.975693, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 15]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 11]]}, "issue": "12"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13097", "archive": ["Portico"], "ISSN": ["1470-0328"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1470-0328", "type": "print"}]}], "items-per-page": 20, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}}
