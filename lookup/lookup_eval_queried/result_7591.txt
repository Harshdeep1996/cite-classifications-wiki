(ASXL1) are common in patients with myeloid leukemias. More recently, mutations in ASXL2, a paralog of ASXL1 with ~40% shared amino acid homology, have been discovered to occur specifically in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients bearing the RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO; RUNX1-RUNX1T1) translocation and are amongst the most common mutations in RUNX1-ETO AML (mutated in 20-25% of patients). Although ASXL1 is critical for Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 function in myeloid hematopoietic cells and loss of Asxl1 recapitulates key aspects of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the function of ASXL2 in normal or malignant hematopoiesis is unknown. We therefore set out to perform a functional comparison of ASXL1and ASXL2on hematopoiesis and transcription and determine the functional basis for frequent mutations in RUNX1-ETO AML.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In vitro analyses of ASXL2 insertion/deletion mutations revealed that these mutations resulted in substantial reduction of ASXL2 protein expression, stability, and half-life. We therefore generated Asxl2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice to delineate the effect of ASXL2 loss on hematopoiesis. Competitive (Fig. 1A) and noncompetitive transplantation revealed that Asxl2 or compound Asxl1/2 loss resulted in cell-autonomous, rapid defects of hematopoietic stem cell function, self-renewal, and number with peripheral blood leukopenia and thrombocytopenia but without any obvious MDS features- phenotypes distinct from Asxl1 cKO mice. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Asxl2 demonstrated an intermediate phenotype between control and homozygous cKO mice indicating a gene dosage effect of Asxl2 loss. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from Asxl2- and Asxl1-deficient mice revealed twenty-fold greater differentially expressed genes in Asxl2 cKO mice relative to Asxl1 cKO mice. Interestingly, genes differentially expressed with Asxl2 loss significantly overlapped with direct transcriptional targets of RUNX1-ETO, findings not seen in Asxl1 cKO mice (Fig. 1B). Asxl2 target genes appeared to also be targets of RUNX1, a key gene repressed by RUNX1-ETO to promote leukemogenesis. Consistent with this, genome-wide analysis of Asxl2 binding sites through anti-Asxl2 ChIP-seq revealed that Asxl2 binding sites substantially overlap with those of Runx1.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Overall, the above data suggest that Asxl2 may be a critical mediator of RUNX1-ETO mediated leukemogenesis by affecting the expression of RUNX1 and/or RUNX1-ETO target genes. RNA-seq of primary RUNX1-ETO AML patient samples revealed that ASXL2-mutant RUNX1-ETO patients form a distinct transcriptional subset of RUNX1-ETO AML (Fig. 1C) suggesting a specific role of ASXL2 in leukemogenesis. To functionally interrogate the role of ASXL2 loss in RUNX1-ETO mediated leukemogenesis we first utilized an in vitro model with RNAi-mediated depletion of ASXL1 or ASXL2 in the SKNO1 cell line (the only ASXL-wildtype human RUNX1-ETO cell line). RNA-seq revealed distinct target genes dysregulated by ASXL1 versus ASXL2 loss in these cells without any significant overlap. Anti-ASXL2, RUNX1, and RUNX1-ETO ChIPSeq in SKNO1 cells revealed significant co-occupancy of ASXL2 with RUNX1 and RUNX1-ETO binding sites. Moreover, analysis of histone modification ChIPSeq revealed an enrichment in intergenic and enhancer H3K4me1 abundance following ASXL2 loss in SKNO1 cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Next, to understand the in vivo effects of Asxl2 loss in the context of RUNX1-ETO, we performed retroviral bone marrow (BM) transplantation assays using RUNX1-ETO9a in Asxl2 cKO mice. In contrast to the failure of hematopoietic stem cell function with Asxl2 deletion alone, mice reconstituted with BM cells expressing RUNX1-ETO9a in Asxl2-deficient background had a shortened leukemia-free survival compared to Asxl2 -wildtype control.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Overall, these data reveal that ASXL2 is required for hematopoiesis and has differing biological and transcriptional functions from ASXL1. Moreover, this work identifies ASXL2 as a novel mediator of RUNX1-ETOtranscriptional function and provides a new model of penetrant RUNX1-ETO AML based on genetic events found in a substantial proportion of t(8;21) AML patients. Further interrogation of the enhancer alterations generated by ASXL2 loss in RUNX1-ETO AML may highlight new therapeutic approaches for this subset of AML.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1.

mutations are observed in almost one-third of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). If the favorable genotype defined by the presence of NPM1 mutations without fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) is known to be associated with favorable outcome in patients with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), impact of these molecular abnormalities are still debated in those with cytogenetically abnormal (CA) AML.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Patients and Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We analyzed the role of these factors in newly diagnosed AML patients homogeneously treated in the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) trials between 1990 and 2006 (ALFA 9000, 9801, 9802). Among 1529 patients (15-70 years of age), 554 patients were screened for NPM1 mutation, FLT3-ITD and have informative karyotype. Mutations screening were centrally performed according to previously described procedures. Karyotype was considered as normal if at least 20 normal marrow metaphases were present without any abnormal marrow metaphases. Favorable core binding factor (CBF) AML (74 patients) were excluded from this analysis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Among the 480 remaining patients, 137 (29%; median age 48 years, range 17-68) were NPM1 mutated, 22 of them (16%) having CA-AML. We found no difference between NPM1 mutated CN-AML patients (n=115) and NPM1 mutated non-CBF CA-AML patients (n=22) in term of complete remission rate (88% vs 83%; P= .49), overall survival (OS) (39% vs 38 % at 5 years, P= .85), event-free survival (EFS) (33% vs 25% at 5 years, P= .39). However, in the context of the favorable genotype, EFS was significantly longer in the 79 CN- than in the 16 CA-AML patients (41% vs 19% at 5 years ; P= .04) with a trend to better OS (51% vs 31% at 5 years ; P= .12). No significant differences were observed in patients with NPM1 mutated AML but FLT3-ITD (5-year EFS, 12% vs 40%; 5-year OS, 20% vs 60%; P= .47 and .27, respectively), even if the numbers of patients were here very low (35 CN- vs 5 CA-AML). More importantly, the favorable genotype was predictive of a longer EFS and OS in the 267 patients with CN-AML (5-year EFS, 41% vs 19%; 5-year OS, 51% vs 30%; P= .0001 and .001, respectively), while no differences were observed in the 213 patients with non-CBF CA-AML (5-year EFS, 19% vs 16%; 5-year OS, 31% vs 27%; P= .38 and .36, respectively).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>As shown, patients with the favorable genotype but CA-AML had an outcome relatively similar to those with a non favorable genotype and either CA- or CN-AML. The favorable outcome associated with NPM1 mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD might thus depend on the presence of a normal karyotype. We thus think that larger studies or overviews are needed to definitely answer this question.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Dombret: Celgene: Consultancy, Honoraria, Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Speakers Bureau.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v114.22.1594.1594", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 9]], "date-time": "2019-10-09T22:33:10Z", "timestamp": 1570660390000}, "page": "1594-1594", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The Role of Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Acute Myeloid Leukemia with NPM1 mutations and No FLT3 Internal Tandem Duplication."], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "114", "author": [{"given": "Jean-Baptiste", "family": "Micol", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France,"}]}, {"given": "Nicolas", "family": "Boissel", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France,"}]}, {"given": "Aline", "family": "Renneville", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Laboratoire d'He\u0301matologie, CHRU, Lille, France,"}]}, {"given": "Sylvie", "family": "Castaigne", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Hematology, Ho\u0302pital Andre\u0301 Mignot, Versailles, France,"}]}, {"given": "Claude", "family": "Gardin", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "European APL group, Bobigny, France,"}]}, {"given": "Claude", "family": "Preudhomme", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Centre de Biologie Pathologie PM Degand; INSERM U837, Lille, France,"}]}, {"given": "Herve", "family": "Dombret", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Hopital Saint Louis AP-HP, Paris, France"}]}], "member": "234", "container-title": ["Blood"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/114/22/1594/63083/The-Role-of-Cytogenetic-Abnormalities-in-Acute", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "syndication"}, {"URL": "https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/114/22/1594/63083/The-Role-of-Cytogenetic-Abnormalities-in-Acute", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 16]], "date-time": "2019-11-16T05:35:35Z", "timestamp": 1573882535000}, "score": 26.489704, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 11, 20]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 11, 20]]}, "issue": "22"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v114.22.1594.1594", "ISSN": ["0006-4971", "1528-0020"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0006-4971", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1528-0020", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["Immunology", "Cell Biology", "Biochemistry", "Hematology"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 5]], "date-time": "2019-12-05T07:21:37Z", "timestamp": 1575530497548}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "American Society of Hematology", "issue": "5", "content-domain": {"domain": ["ashpublications.org"], "crossmark-restriction": true}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1989, 4, 1]]}, "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In this study we examine the effects of amino acid deprivation on the growth and differentiation of the human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line. The HL-60 cell line was chosen for study because of its ability to differentiate along either a granulocytic or monocytic pathway under appropriate culture conditions. Differentiation was determined by changes in cell morphology, nonspecific esterase (NSE) content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and expression of the cell surface differentiation antigens LeuM3 (CD14) and OKM1 (CD11). Using a model system in which HL-60 cells were cultured in medium that selectively lacked one amino acid (AA), it was seen that deprivation of HL-60 cells for essential (but not nonessential) AAs results in decreased cell growth and viability and in differentiation of 30% to 60% of the surviving population of cells specifically along the monocytic pathway. This differentiation is irreversible as well as time- and dose- dependent. Culture of HL-60 cells in essential AA-deficient medium potentiated the differentiative effects of recombinant human interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma), recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), all of which have previously been shown to induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Differentiated cells had decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, but protein synthesis was unchanged compared with control cells.

The HL-60 cell line was chosen for study because of its ability to differentiate along either a granulocytic or monocytic pathway under appropriate culture conditions. Differentiation was determined by changes in cell morphology, nonspecific esterase (NSE) content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and expression of the cell surface differentiation antigens LeuM3 (CD14) and OKM1 (CD11). Using a model system in which HL-60 cells were cultured in medium that selectively lacked one amino acid (AA), it was seen that deprivation of HL-60 cells for essential (but not nonessential) AAs results in decreased cell growth and viability and in differentiation of 30% to 60% of the surviving population of cells specifically along the monocytic pathway. This differentiation is irreversible as well as time- and dose- dependent. Culture of HL-60 cells in essential AA-deficient medium potentiated the differentiative effects of recombinant human interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma), recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), all of which have previously been shown to induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Chromosome 3q abnormalities, including aberrant expression of EVI-1, represent a small subset of patients and are associated with a poor outcome in both MDS and AML patients treated with conventional treatment. Azacitidine is the current standard of care for high-risk MDS and is also active in AML. Given that AZA may provide responses in patients with poor chances of response to conventional treatment as patients with monosomy 7 and given the strong epigenetic modifications related to EVI-1 dysregulation, AZA may represent an interesting option for patients with 3q abnormalities. Therefore, we analyzed the outcome of patients with Chromosome 3q abnormalities treated with Azacitidine.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Patients and methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This is a retrospective multicenter study.

This cohort of patients was compared to 406 high risk MDS and AML patients without 3q abnormalities included in the French AZA compassional program.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A total of 184 patients were analyzed. Median age was 64 years. According to WHO classification, patients presented RA/RCMD/RAEB-1 28% of cases, RAEB-2/CMML-2 31% of cases, and AML 41% of cases. Median bone marrow blast count was 15%. Cytogenetics were inv(3)/t(3;3) 22%, del(3q)/monosomy 3 26%, t(3q26;x) 20%, EVI-1 overexpression without 3q abnormality 14%, t(3q21;x) 4% and other 3q abnormalities 14%. 58% of patients had complex karyotype. Azacitidine was used frontline for 67% of patients, 33% being previously treated with intensive chemotherapy. Median number of cycle of azacitidine was 5 (1-33). Overall response rate was 47% (Complete or Partial response 27%). 31 patients (25% of patients younger than 70y) bridged to allogeneic transplantation. With a median follow-up of 16 months, median overall survival was 10.5 months. Younger age (below 65y, 13m vs 10m, p=0.052), low bone marrow blast count (below 20%, 13m vs 8m, p=0.001), presence of t(3q21;x) (74 vs 10 months, p=0.008), few cytogenetic abnormalities (below 3, 14m vs 9m, p=0.003), and use of Azacitidine frontline (13m vs 8 m, p=0.029) were associated with a better survival. Long term survival remains limited with a 3 years survival probability below 10%. Interestingly, baseline characteristics and prognosis of patients with EVI-1 overexpression without 3q cytogenetic abnormality were comparable with patients with 3q26 cytogenetic abberation. Then, we compared our cohort with MDS/AML patients without 3q abnormalities, their overall response rate was 30% (41% for HR MDS, 15% for AML, including 11% CR/PR), and median OS was 10.5 months (15 months for HR MDS and 7 months for AML). When we merged the 2 cohorts and performed multivariate analyses, presence of 3q abnormality had no prognosis impact on either response or survival.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Azacitidine seems to limit the dismal outcome associated with 3q abnormalities and thus represents a good alternative to conventional chemotherapy including for patients eligible for allogeneic transplantation.

Relapsing patients are frequently targeted for new drug development, but few data are available on their outcome and optimal management. With the aim to provide historical data for future drug evaluation, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 393 patients aged \u226550 years in first relapse after prospective inclusion in ALFA 9801 (NCT00931138) and 9803 (NCT00363025) ICT trials.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Patients.</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Median age was 64 years (50\u201382). Median duration of first complete remission (CR1) was 9 months (1\u201369). Twelve patients had prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation. At diagnosis, cytogenetics was as follows: 16 favorable (4%), 240 intermediate (61%), 76 adverse (19%), and 61 failed or not done (16%), 173 patients having a normal karyotype (NK). Twenty-nine of 174 patients tested at diagnosis had FLT3-ITD (17%), while the incidence of NPM1, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2 or WT1 mutation was 24%, 4%, 9%, 10% and 2%, respectively. Among 86 NK-AML patients tested, 24 had a favorable genotype (NPM1 or CEBPA mutation without FLT3-ITD). At relapse, median WBC was 3.4 \u00d7 109/L and ECOG-PS &gt;1 in 28% of patients. Relapse management was best supportive care (BSC, 32%), low-dose cytarabine (LDAC, 12%), ICT (38%), ICT combined with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, 5%), or GO alone (10%). As expected, patients who received LDAC or BSC were significantly older and tended to have more frequent unfavorable karyotype. Conversely, patient and AML characteristics were comparable in the ICT, ICT+GO, and GO subsets.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results.</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Complete remission (CR) rate was 31% and median post-relapse survival was 6.8 months (0%, 17%, 53%, 80%, 42.5% and 3.2, 5.6, 9, 19.8, 8.9 months in BSC, LDAC, ICT, ICT+GO, and GO subsets, respectively). CR2 rate and post-relapse survival were comparable in both GO and ICT subsets, while CR2 rate was higher (P=0.02) and survival longer (P=0.04) in the ICT+GO versus the ICT subset. Median post-relapse survival was 17.3 months in patients who achieved CR2 versus 4.2 months in those who did not (p&lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, age, CR1 duration, WBC, ECOG-PS, and favorable karyotype influenced both CR2 rate and post-relapse survival. Median post-relapse survival reached 16.2 months in patients with favorable karyotype versus 6.2 months in other patients (P&lt;0.001). The presence of FLT3-ITD at diagnosis was associated with shorter post-relapse survival (3 versus 7 months, P=0.03). Interestingly, outcome was similar in NK patients with or without a favorable genotype, as well as in patients with an intermediate or even an adverse karyotype. Besides favorable karyotype, multivariate analysis allowed to identify CR1 duration &lt;12 months (HR, 1.8; P&lt;0.001), ECOG-PS \u22652 (HR, 2.0; P&gt;0.001), age (P=0.001) and WBC (P=0.03), but not FLT3-ITD, as independent factors for shorter survival. To evaluate the role of the different management options, which were dependent of patient and disease characteristics as well as physician's choice, we matched patients treated intensively (ICT/ICT+GO/GO) to those not treated intensively (LDAC/BSC) using a propensity score. This methodology allows comparing both approaches by reducing the multidimensional covariates associated with the intensive option to a single one-dimensional score used for patient matching. In 76 patient pairs, intensive salvage (HR, 0.49, P&lt;0.001), good ECOG-PS (HR, 0.44, P&lt;0.001), and CR1 duration \u226512 months (HR, 0.55, P=0.001) were associated with longer post-relapse survival. The benefit associated with intensive treatment was more marked in patients with CR1 duration \u226512 months (1-year post-relapse survival, 58% versus 24%; P=0.001) than in those with CR1 duration &lt;12 months (1-year post-relapse survival, 25% versus 13%; P=0.09).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion.</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>If, as expected, favorable karyotype and longer CR1 duration predicted better post-relapse outcome in older AML patients, other karyotypes or genotypes did not. Patients with CR1 duration \u226512 months did benefit from intensive salvage. Intensive treatment should thus remain the current control arm in trials evaluating new alternatives in late relapsing patients, while LDAC/BSC may still be considered as an adequate control arm in patients relapsing within the first year of CR1.

The WHO 2008 classification individualize the therapy related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a specific entity and highlight the role of chemotherapy/radiotherapy in the pathogenesis of the disease. There is a demonstrated link between specific therapeutic agents, recurrent genetic lesions (such as t(15;17), CBF AML, monosomy 7, \u2026), and outcome. However, most of the published series include multiple types of primary cancer and treatments. This heterogeneity may represent a problem as only limited data are available in patients with specific cancer subtypes, such as the most frequent one, breast cancer. This may be important at a public health level but also to homogenize age and types of prior treatment. Moreover, the complexity of t-AML could not be resumed to the association between treatment and karyotype, as some patients developed AML without chemotherapy, suggesting a potential predisposition to AML. In the present report, we focused on AML arising after breast cancer (BC) and describe the characteristics and outcome of this population.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Patients and Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This is a retrospective multicenter study. Patients were included if they had the diagnosis of breast cancer preceding diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia whatever may be the interval between the 2 cancers and whatever treatment was administered for BC. All patients with AML were treated with induction chemotherapy. Clinical and biological data for both cancers were collected. Patient\u2019s characteristics and results were compared with age, cytogenetic risk, and optionally sex matched (if possible) de novo AML with a 2/1 ratio.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>408 patients were analyzed, including 136 AML associated with BC and 272 de novo AML. The median age at diagnosis of BC was 50 years. 47% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma. Treatment of BC included chemotherapy in 81% of cases, radiotherapy in 91% of cases, and surgery in 99% of cases. The median time between BC and AML was 2.8 years. Median WBC was 3.4G/l and median platelets count was 49G/l. For AML-BC, Cytogenetics were abnormal in 82% of cases including 12% Complex Karyotype, 12% t(15;17), 17% CBF, and 20% MLL translocations. The recent introduction of taxanes in the treatment of BC did not seem to change the frequencies of these aberrations. With the exception of sex ratio, there was no significant difference of baseline characteristics as compared to control group. Regarding induction chemotherapy, CR rate was 81% and 8-week mortality 11.6%. In the control cohort, CR rate was 83% (p=NS) and 8 week mortality 7% (p=NS). Allogeneic transplantation was performed in 21% and 17% of patients respectively. In cytogenetic adjusted survival analysis, median overall survival and relapse free survival were similar between AML-BC and de novo AML for favorable risk (OS and RFS not reached for both groups; p=0.06 and p=0.3 respectively), and unfavorable risk (OS 12m vs. 13m p=NS, RFS 8m vs. 9m p=NS) groups. Interestingly, there was a difference for intermediate cytogenetics group, with median OS (21 months vs. 38 months p=0.01) and median RFS (14 vs. 25 months p=0.04). Difference was also confirmed for cumulative incidence of relapse (1 year probability 41% vs. 22%, p=0.04). Frequency of FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations were only available in a subset of patients. Only 1/12 pts in the intermediate AML-BC group was FLT3 mutated and 1/12 pt had isolated NPM1 mutation. In the de novo cohort, 11/28 pts had FLT3 mutations and 8/21 pts had isolated NPM1 mutation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Our data showed that in AML arising after BC, the prior BC do not appear to impact the outcome in favorable and unfavorable cytogenetic risk groups. However, this is different for intermediate risk cytogenetics, our data suggesting a poorer outcome of AML-BC and potentially a different mutational profile. Regarding AML susceptibility, a matched pair analysis comparing the AML-BC and BC without AML will also be presented at the meeting.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n
