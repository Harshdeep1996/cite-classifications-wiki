However, cell lysis is one of a major problem during the excretion of recombinant protein due to the pressure build up in the periplasmic space through overproduction of the expressed recombinant protein. Cell immobilization is a promising solution for the improvement of protein excretion with reduction in cell lysis. In this study, the effect of cross linkers concentrations on the process of cell immobilization for the cyclodextringlucanotransferase (CGTase) excretion and cell viability were investigated. The hollow fiber membrane was treated using different concentrations (0.3, 0.67 and 1%) of cross linkers namely glutaraldehyde (GA), poly-L-lysine (PLL) and polyethylenimine (PEI). The optimum concentration of cross linkers was found to be 0.3% with the high excretion of CGTase. Interestingly, the immobilized cell on the non-treated hollow fiber membrane showed up to 15% increment of CGTase excretion with 55% reduction of cell lysis, as compared to the immobilized cells on the treated hollow fiber membrane. It could be concluded that, the low concentration of cross linkers exhibited the highest CGTase excretion. Moreover, the non-treated hollow fiber membrane is a promising approach for attachment of cells to the membrane without requiring treatment with any chemicals for the production of recombinant enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical Engineering Research Bulletin 19(2017) 154-159&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/cerb.v19i0.33810", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017,

Steinman, Z.A. Cohn. 1980, J.Cell Biol. 86:292-314), we found that the membrane of macrophage phagolysosomes could be selectively radioiodinated in living cells, The technique required phagocytosis of lactoperoxidase covalently coupled to latex spheres (LPO-latex), followed by iodination on ice with Na(125)I and hydrogen peroxide. In this paper, we use the LPO-latex system to further analyze the composition and recycling of phagocytic vacuole membrane.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Three approaches were employed to examine the polypeptide composition of the phagolysosome (PL) and plasma membranes (PM). (a) The efficiency of intracellular iodination was increased by increasing lysosomal pH with chloroquine. By one-dimensional SDS PAGE, the heavily labeled chloroquine-treated PL exhibited the same labeled polypeptides as PM iodinated extracellularly with LPO-latex. (b) Iodinated PL and PM were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. No differences in the isoelectric point and molecular weight of the major iodinated species were detected. (c) Quantitative immune precipitation was performed with five specific antibodies directed against cell surface antigens. Four antibodies precipitated similar relative amounts of labeled antigen on the cell surface and endocytic vacuole. One antibody, secreted by hybridoma 2.6, detected a 21-kdalton polypeptide that was enriched sevenfold in PL membrane. This enrichment was cell surface-derived, since the amount of labeled 2.6 was increased sevenfold when iodinated PM was driven into the cell during latex uptake. Therefore, intracellular iodination primarily detects PL proteins that are identical to their PM counterparts.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Additional studies employed electron microscope autoradiography to monitor the centrifugal flow of radiolabeled polypeptides from PL to PM. Cells were iodinated intralysosomally and returned to culture for only 5-10 min at 37 degrees C. Most of the cell-associated label then redistributed to the cell surface or its adjacent area. Significant movement out of the lysosome compartment occurred even at 2 degrees C and 22 degrees C. Extensive and rapid membrane flow through the secondary lysosome presumably contributes to the great similarity between PM and PL membrane polypeptides.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1083/jcb.96.1.29", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 5, 14]], "date-time": "2004-05-14T23:04:59Z", "timestamp": 1084575899000}, "page": "29-36", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.crossmarkpolicy", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 39, "title": ["Membrane proteins of the vacuolar system.

Leaves of the golden passionfruit (Passiflora edulis forma flavicarpa were used as the experimental material. \n    Heat injury to the chloroplast thylakoid membranes began above 35\u00b0C as evidenced by abnormal changes in chlorophyll fluorescence and absorbance and inactivation of chloroplast membrane activities. Chlorophyll fluorescence increased and chlorophyll absorbance decreased above 35\u00b0C and the increase and decrease, respectively, were greatest at 52\u00b0C. \n    The measurements made on intact leaf tissue together with assays of photosystem 2 activity in isolated chloroplasts indicated the relative thermostabilities of several chloroplast membrane activities. Inactivation of photosystem 2 activity linked to oxygen evolution appeared to be associated with membrane changes occurring between 35 and 44\u00b0C. The 518-nm absorbance changes indicated that energy-dependent proton pumping and associated reactions were inactivated between 44 and 48\u00b0C. Photosystem-1-mediated photooxidation of cytochrome-554 became inactivated between 48 and 52\u00b0C. \n    These studies demonstrate that chlorophylls, carotenoids and cytochrome f may be used as intrinsic membrane probes for monitoring the development of heat injury in the chloroplast membrane system. The absorbance and fluorescence changes that these compounds undergo upon heating provide a basis for reliable and rapid methods applicable to intact tissue for determining heat sensitivity in green plants. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/pp9790121", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2006, 1, 4]], "date-time": "2006-01-04T01:09:06Z", "timestamp": 1136336946000}, "page": "121", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 16, "title": ["Coloured Components of Chloroplast Membranes as Intrinsic Membrane Probes for Monitoring the Development of Heat Injury in Intact Tissues"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "RM", "family": "Smillie", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Functional Plant Biology"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/pdf/PP9790121", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2018-11-23T02:12:28Z", "timestamp": 1542939148000}, "score": 18.163778, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1979]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1979]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["PP9790121"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/pp9790121", "ISSN": ["1445-4408"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1445-4408", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2019-11-21T18:07:56Z", "timestamp": 1574359676727}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Elsevier BV", "issue": "6", "license": [{"URL": "https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[1998, 12, 1]], "date-time": "1998-12-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 912470400000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["American Journal of Kidney Diseases"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1998, 12]]}, "DOI": "10.1016/s0272-6386(98)70165-9", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2008, 3, 25]], "date-time": "2008-03-25T18:38:05Z", "timestamp": 1206470285000}, "page": "S71-S75", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 19, "title": ["Influence of the dialysis membrane on outcome of ESRD patients"], "prefix": "10.1016", "volume": "32", "author": [{"given": "RM", "family": "Hakim", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "78", "container-title": ["American Journal of Kidney Diseases"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0272638698701659?httpAccept=text/xml", "content-type": "text/xml", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0272638698701659?httpAccept=text/plain", "content-type": "text/plain", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 30]], "date-time": "2018-12-30T20:20:57Z", "timestamp": 1546201257000}, "score": 18.163778, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1998, 12]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1998, 12]]}, "issue": "6"}, "alternative-id": ["S0272638698701659"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0272-6386(98)70165-9", "ISSN": ["0272-6386"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0272-6386", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 19]], "date-time": "2019-11-19T07:22:44Z", "timestamp": 1574148164195}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "CSIRO Publishing", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Aust.

The carbamate was without effect and although all phenoxyacetic acid compounds were markedly toxic, they differed in the rapidity of their action. Wheat (Triticum vulgare) exhibited differential responses to phenoxyacetic acid compounds and to isopropyl phenylcarbaniate at different growth stages. Applications of four phenoxyacetic acid compounds to wheat at different stages of development, from late seedling to flowering, showed that grain yields were reduced most markedly by applications in the seedling stage; the butyl ester and amine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were more toxic than the sodium salt. \n0.1 per cent. foliage sprays of isopropyl phenylcarbamate had no effect on wheat in the late seedling or tillering stages, but severely depressed the yield of grain when applied at flowering. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) responded similarly. Higher concentrations applied to wheat at pre-shooting also reduced grain yields. \nFlax (Linum sitatissimum), although susceptible to pre-emergence treatment, was not affected by foliage sprays of isopropyl phenylcarbamate at any growth-stage.  0.1 per cent. applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as the sodium salt reduced flax yields only when applied at the seedling stage.  </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9500401", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T01:49:10Z", "timestamp": 1100656150000}, "page": "401", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Differential effects of certain phenoxyacetic acid compounds and phenylcarbamates on plant species.
