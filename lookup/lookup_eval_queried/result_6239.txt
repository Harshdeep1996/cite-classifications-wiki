It shows the continuing importance of the local, even for such transnational religious movements as African churches. Constructing a worship location confronts the churches with the 'ingrained orders of social power in the host society' (Favell 2003). They encountered familiar black \u2013 white distinctions, a legion of 'white helpers' and a long process of building trust. I argue that African churches use transnational and local strategies. Becoming part of the local is inspired by missionary motives and is related to the character of religious congregations as relatively fixed organisations which nurture a practice of engagement with local society. Cet article se concentre sur l'interaction des \u00e9glises africaines avec l'\u00e9cologie locale au niveau sociale, politique et religieuse du Sud-est d'Amsterdam dans leur recherche de l'espace de culte. Cela d\u00e9montre l'importance ininterrompue du local, m\u00eame pour des mouvements religieux transnationaux comme les \u00e9glises africaines. La construction d'un espace de culte confronte les \u00e9glises avec \u00ab les ordres enracin\u00e9s du pouvoir social dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00f4te \u00bb (Favell 2003). Ils rencontrent la distinction habituelle entre noir et blanc, une l\u00e9gion d'\u00ab aide blanche \u00bb et un long processus de construire la confiance. Je soutiens que des \u00e9glises africaines utilisent des strat\u00e9gies transnationales et locales. Devenir une partie des locaux est inspir\u00e9 par des motifs de missionnaire et est rapproch\u00e9 du caract\u00e8re des congr\u00e9gations religieuses comme les organisations relativement fixes qui \u00e9l\u00e8vent une pratique d'engagement avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 locale.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>", "DOI": "10.1163/187254509x12477244375094", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 7, 3]], "date-time": "2010-07-03T14:37:11Z", "timestamp": 1278167831000}, "page": "159-181", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["The Continuing Importance of the Local.
