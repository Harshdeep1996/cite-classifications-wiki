This chapter deals with financial relief during divorce, nullity and judicial separation proceedings, and child support. The first question is a problem question that requires discussion of financial support during marriage, financial orders on divorce and the factors contained in s. 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The second problem question focuses on financial orders on divorce and variation and appeal of financial orders. The third question is an essay question on the development of the law relating to pre-nuptial and post-nuptial contracts, whilst the final essay question focuses on child support, which is primarily regulated by the Child Support Act 1991.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/he/9780198817482.003.0007", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 28]], "date-time": "2018-09-28T11:51:44Z", "timestamp": 1538135504000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["7.
