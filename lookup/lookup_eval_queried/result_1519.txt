However, calculations indicated that preference for forages with an intake rate of less than 15 g/min would decline as feed intake was raised to the highest level.

The holes were spaced in rows from 10 to 50 mm apart, and, with one, two or three tillers per hole, tiller density ranged from 346 to 25 980/m2. Sward height was varied by pulling tillers different distances through the holes before they were fastened to the underside of the boards, and the mass of herbage dry matter ranged from 0.04 to 7.61 t/ha. In series I experiments, the effects of sward characteristics on ingestive behaviour of two sheep were examined, whereas, in series I1 experiments, pastures that were consumed at different rates were offered in pairs and the preference of one sheep observed. The rate of pasture intake was related to sward height only when tiller density was constant and to herbage mass per unit volume (bulk density) only at similar sward heights. Intake rate was better described by herbage mass per unit area but, at herbage availabilities of less than 1 t/ha, intake rate was several-fold greater when sheep grazed tall, sparse pastures than short, dense pastures. The best predictor of pasture intake rate was herbage mass per area effectively covered by one bite. Intake per prehending bite declined with a reduction in both sward height and density, and was also best described by herbage mass per area effectively covered by one bite. Prehending bite rate doubled as intake per bite declined from 200 to 10 mg dry matter. The rate of jaw movements during grazing was virtually unaffected by sward characteristics; prehending bites accounted for 20% of jaw movements when intake per bite was 200 mg dry matter and 80% of jaw movements with short, widely spaced swards.

Intake rates ranged from 5.5 to 26.1 g/min, but, within each forage, it varied little between sheep (c.v. 13%) or between measurements with the same sheep (c.v. 8%). The forages were then offered in pairs in separate containers and preference for one forage was defined as the percentage of total intake derived from that forage. With the exception of a dried clover pasture, preference for a forage was strongly related to the rate at which it could be eaten. Reducing the length of wheaten straw particles from 30 to 10 mm increased intake rate from 5.5 to 12.4 g/min and resulted in an absolute preference for the short material. The mean preference for a forage over all comparisons was more strongly correlated with intake rate of the forage (r2 = 0.87) than with in vitro digestibility of organic matter (r2 = 0.30). In experiment 2, two wheaten straws and two wheaten hays were each chopped to two lengths and, within each forage, mixed (w/w) in the short : long ratios of 0 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 1 and 1 : 0. Mean intake rates were 7.3 and 12.5 g/min for the two straws and 15.7 and 23.2 g/min for the two hays. Within each forage, all mixtures were offered in pairs to establish preference. The slopes of regression equations relating preference (%) to intake rate (g/min) were 21.4, 17.0, 5.9 and 2.7 (%.min/g) for the four forages as mean intake rate increased from 7.3 to 23 2 g/min, which indicates that discrimination between forages with the same difference in intake rate was greater when mean intake rate was low. In experiment 3, finely ground clover pasture, lucerne hay, wheaten hay or wheaten straw were added to a base diet of either chopped lucerne or wheaten straw in the ratio 1 : 10. Although the additive had little effect on intake rate, sheep preferred lucerne to clover pasture and wheaten hay to wheaten straw. Equations developed from the results of experiment 2 to predict the preference for one forage over another on the basis of their relative intake rates, showed fair agreement with observations from experiment 1, particularly when the effects of acceptability factors such as taste, odour or feel were translated into differences in potential intake rate.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9840551", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 18]], "date-time": "2004-11-18T00:16:53Z", "timestamp": 1100737013000}, "page": "551", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 61, "title": ["Factors affecting diet selection by sheep. 1.

Treading only (experiment 1) increased the bulk density of soil by 40% as the stocking rate increased from 0 to 39.2 sheep ha-1. This caused a 33% reduction in late winter production (July), the decline (675 kg ha-1) being due mainly to a reduction in the proportion of ryegrass in the pasture. The combined impacts of treading and grazing (experiment 2) proved more detrimental to subsequent pasture recovery. At the July measurement, treading reduced production by 20% when the stocking rate was increased from 0 to 19.6 sheep ha-1, while the combined effect produced a 58% loss in yield. In addition to stocking rate, the length of the pre-grazing establishment period proved critical, with greater compaction evident in plots stocked 24 h after irrigation. This compaction affected the botanical composition, significantly more ryegrass being present in compacted plots, although increased tillering was encouraged by intense defoliation at high stocking rates which intensified this effect.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9790741", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T22:54:59Z", "timestamp": 1100732099000}, "page": "741", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 11, "title": ["The effects of sheep treading and grazing on pasture and soil characteristics of irrigated annual pastures"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "30", "author": [{"given": "PA", "family": "Witschi", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "DL", "family": "Michalk", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Agricultural Research"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/AR/pdf/AR9790741", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T04:37:37Z", "timestamp": 1542775057000}, "score": 17.900991, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1979]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1979]]}, "issue": "4"}, "alternative-id": ["AR9790741"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ar9790741", "ISSN": ["0004-9409"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0004-9409", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 20]], "date-time": "2019-11-20T21:24:15Z", "timestamp": 1574285055169}, "reference-count": 11, "publisher": "Wiley", "issue": "4", "license": [{"URL": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1", "start": {"date-parts": [[2015, 9, 1]], "date-time": "2015-09-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1441065600000}, "delay-in-days": 3075, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Australian Vet J"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2007, 4]]}, "DOI": "10.1111/j.0005-0423.2007.00135.x", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2007, 3, 29]], "date-time": "2007-03-29T14:48:56Z", "timestamp": 1175179736000}, "page": "129-133", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 14, "title": ["Lesions attributed to vaccination of sheep with Gudair? for the control of ovine paratuberculosis: post farm economic impacts at slaughter"], "prefix": "10.1111", "volume": "85", "author": [{"given": "J", "family": "Eppleston", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "PA", "family": "Windsor", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "311", "reference": [{"key": "b1_128", "author": "Seamen JT", "volume": "57", "first-page": "102", "year": "1981", "journal-title": "Aust Vet J", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1751-0813.1981.tb00465.x", "doi-asserted-by": "crossref"}, {"key": "b2_129", "DOI": "10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.12.021", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3_130", "author": "Sigurdsson B", "volume": "58", "first-page": "271", "year": "1949", "journal-title": "J Bacteriol"}, {"key": "b4_131", "author": "Doyle TM.", "volume": "76", "first-page": "73", "year": "1964", "journal-title": "Vet Rec"}, {"key": "b5_132", "author": "Chiodini R", "volume": "74", "first-page": "218", "year": "1984", "journal-title": "Cornell Vet"}, {"key": "b6_133", "unstructured": "6.
