It was also found that miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation was related to differential target gene expression; the genes with miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation were downregulated during cell senescence and upregulated during cellular differentiation. Promoter hypomethylation was especially enhanced for genes targeted by miR-548 miRNAs, which are non-conserved, primate-specific miRNAs that are typically expressed at lower levels than the frequently investigated conserved miRNAs.</ns4:p><ns4:p><ns4:bold>Conclusions</ns4:bold> It was found that promoter methylation was affected by miRNA targeting. Furthermore, miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation is suggested to facilitate gene regulation by miRNAs that are not strongly expressed (e.g., miR-548 miRNAs).</ns4:p>", "DOI":

Taguchi</b>; \n<i>Posted: 16 May 2013</i>; Dear Denis,&nbsp;Thank you very much for your efforts to review my paper. Here I respond to you point by point. If these responses resolve disagreements between us and then if you can approve my manuscript, I will be happy. Alternatively, you may suggest how to revise my manuscript such that you can approve it.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;I had initially understood that the title of this study could be: &quot;Correlation between promoter methylation and miRNA regulation of target genes.&quot; Which in simpler terms could mean that miRNA targeted genes tend to have more hypomethylated promoters (or hypermethylated maybe) than expected by chance. </i> \n<i>&gt;In the current form it is still unclear to me how the data actually support this conclusion.&nbsp;</i>Unfortunately, I did not intend to conclude that \u201cmiRNA targeted genes tend to have more hypomethylated promoters (or hypermethylated maybe) than expected by chance\u201d, but tried to conclude that \u201ca set of genes targeted by a miRNA A is differently hypo/hypermethylated than a set of genes not targeted by the miRNA A but targeted by any other miRNAs\u201d. These two are very different.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The lack of illustration makes the article hard to follow, the author present the results of statistical tests without providing a clear description of what effect he is actually evaluating. And on further reading it seems that the objective of this study is largely incomprehensible to me.&nbsp;</i>What I have evaluated is, as mentioned in the main text;1.) \u201ca set of genes targeted by a miRNA A is differently hypo/hypermethylated than a set of genes not targeted by the miRNA A but targeted by any other miRNAs\u201d&nbsp;2.) \u201cthe correlation of P-values between miRNA-targeting-promoter methylation (in the sense denoted in 1.) and miRNA-mediated regulation of target genes\u201d. I also defined these two using equations, more exactly. I would be glad if you can mention in which point you are not sure.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The first question comes in the dataset compilation: how was it done and what were the criteria used to accept or reject data used in the study? </i> \n<i>&gt;A figure representing the process of dataset generation would be welcome.&nbsp;</i>As I have mentioned in the Methods section (mRNA and miRNA expression profiles), what I have done is to just make mean and variance, zero and one, respectively. I have never done any other treatments. Thus, I assumed that no detailed explanations were required. If I was not correct, please advise me about how to to prepare suitable figures.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The author states: \u201cI tested profiles from this dataset to confirm that obtained results were not research group dependent.\u201d How was this done? It is well known that biological experiments on a genome scale are inherently noisy so results even within the same group will not be the exact replicate of one another. What was considered acceptable to create a dataset compendium? Was any normalization applied? Was there an a posteriori check that the independent sets were behaving in the same way as the compendium? If not, would the same conclusion have been obtained by analyzing them separately? Is only part of the data driving the conclusion and can it be explained by the different cell lines?&nbsp;</i>I have compared one experiment with another experiment, only using the correlation coefficients of P-values. Almost all analyses were performed in P-value based. As you pointed out, raw values like gene expression and promoter methylation are hard to compare between different experiments. All success in this study is achieved by the employment of P-value based approaches.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Elsewhere, the author states \u201cIt should be noted that genes that were not the targets of any miRNAs were totally excluded from the analysis\u201d which makes me think that I totally missed the initial point of this work as I thought the objective was to test the hypothesis that promoter methylation status was related to miRNA targeting of the produced messenger. In this, genes that are not targets of miRNA would be useful as a control group.</i>\n<i>&gt;Even if the author is trying to demonstrate a relationship between the amount of miRNA regulation and methylation, non-target genes would be an essential control.&nbsp;</i>As I have mentioned above, the purpose of this study was to compare promoter methylation between genes targeted by different miRNAs. Thus, non-target genes cannot be any controls in this context. However, since you require me to clearly&nbsp;point&nbsp;this&nbsp;out, I show this in Table 3.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The second question arises from the choice of the values used for methylation. The author states: \u201cI employed a method in which total methylation values were used(..) because I found that P-values computed when using methylation data were more strongly correlated to the P-values calculated from target gene miRNA regulation data, which is likely due to the fact that the frequency of CpGs is also related to miRNA targeting\u201d&nbsp;</i>\n<i>&gt;and later:&nbsp;</i>\n<i>&gt;\u201c\u03b2i was the ratio of methylated sites to unmethylated sites, (...) were deposited in the public datasets used, their use could not be avoided; however, as a result, the correlation with target gene miRNA regulation was substantially decreased. An explanation for this is noted above.\u201d&nbsp; </i>\n<i>&gt;\u201cObtaining a better P-value\u201d, is not an acceptable rationale for changing the way the methylation of a promoter is \u201ctypically represented\u201d.&nbsp;</i>I did not insist that \u201cObtaining a better P-value\u201d is the criterion to choose which definition of methylation should be employed. I wrote that better correlation of P-values between miRNA-targeting-specific promoter methylation and miRNA regulation of target genes is the criterion to choose which definition of methylation should be employed.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The reason why the association between CpG island associated genes and miRNA targeting explains the difference in P-values between using total methylation values and proportion of methylated sites, is not obvious. It hints at a different behavior between CpG and non CpG promoters, would it not then make sense to process them separately?&nbsp;</i>As I have mentioned in the manuscript, there are some differences. However, the correlation between P-values for miRNA-targeting-specific promoter methylation and P-values for miRNA-mediated regulation of target genes is significant. In fact, for GSM739940, I had to employ \u03b2-values, but the correlation is still significant (see Table 6). Thus, I think that selection of values that represent promoter methylation to be investigated is not essential for the purpose of this manuscript. If you think that you need more evaluations, please advise me about what kind of evaluation is useful for you to be satisfied.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;It seems that the two ways of representing the data mean very different things and that decision could greatly affect the conclusions that can be extracted from the results. If I understand correctly, with the absolute number method a promoter with 2/3 methylated sites would be counted the same as a 2/10 yet in one case one could consider the first to be 66% methylated and the other 20%. The implication of this choice on the results of the study should be discussed more thoroughly.&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the above, since both ratio and amount of methylation work more or less well, I do not think that \u201cdecision could greatly affect the conclusions\u201d. However, if you can suggest some kind of additional evaluations, I am happy to perform this so as to fulfill your requirements.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;In table 1, if the top part is indeed calculated with ratio and bottom with absolute, what were the thresholds to be counted as hypomethylated in each case?&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the text, I employed P-values to check if the promoters are hyper/hypomethylated. Threshold of P-values is, as denoted in the manuscript, P&lt;0.05 after adjusted based on BH criterion.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;What does the \u201cnumber of miRNA\u201d actually represent? The author indicates that he multiplied the number of miRNA (1971) by the number of cell lines included (271). What does this product represent in the end? Why were the datapoints not aggregated by promoter and/or miRNA in the context of this study?&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the manuscript, P-values are attributed not to each gene but to each miRNA. Thus, in the framework of the present study, it is impossible to attribute P-values to each promoter. Also, P-values are attributed to miRNAs in each cell line, because each cell line has a different pattern of promoter methylation. Thus, in some cell lines a miRNA's target genes' promoters are significantly hyper/hypomethylated, while they may not be in other cell lines. Thus, to each miRNA, the number of P-values attributed is the number of cell line. Thus, I get the number of cell lines times number of miRNAs P-values in total.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Table 3 for example is symptomatic of how the lack of illustration makes the article hard to follow: \u201cP-values that represent the difference of promoter methylation between miRNA target genes and miRNA non-target genes.\u201d The P-value doesn't represent a \u201cdifference in promoter methylation\u201d, it evaluates the likelihood of the observation happening by chance given the dataset distribution. But what is the observation here? Are promoters of genes targeted by miRNA 60% methylated vs 58% for the non targeted? (is it 10 vs 87?)&nbsp;</i>It depends upon the statistical test employed, since I used three statistical tests. For the t-test, your expectation is more or less true, since the t-test compares mean values between two sets (although I used amount of methylation, not ratio, as denoted in the text) . For other tests, other statistical values are used in order to check significant difference.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Are we considering a very slight effect with a very strong statistical significance or a very obvious strong effect for which the statistical test is not even needed to be convinced of the solidity of the result?&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the above, the essence of this study is to consider the correlation of P-values. This is the only useful variable to compare different experiments. Thus, I cannot answer your question. Using only P-values, I cannot distinguish between two cases:\u201ca very slight effect with a very strong statistical significance\u201d and \u201ca very obvious strong effect for which the statistical test is not even needed to be convinced of the solidity of the result\u201d, but considering other variables make the comparison between the different experiments impossible, as you suggested in the above. However, as I have mentioned in the above, employment of P-value based analyses is essential to derive conclusions in this paper.\n<i>&gt;Moreover, just below that table the author explains why he doesn't discriminate between hypo and hypermethylation of promoters. That makes table 3 very puzzling; is this P-value evaluating the likelihood of miRNA targeted gene promoters to be significantly BOTH over and/or under methylated relative to non-targeted genes?&nbsp;</i>Yes, I did not distinguish between these two cases. However, if you wish, it is not difficult to investigate it if I used a one-sided test.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Table 4 has been added as a response to my previous comment however it seems to bring further question as to what \u201cmiRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation\u201d really means. My first comment is that this control should not constitute a separate table but an additional entry in the original table.&nbsp;</i>I am not sure what kind of information you need. Please advise me what to do.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Secondly, there are many ways to generate random shuffling of the data that will destroy the \u201csignal\u201d, however for a random shuffling to be a valid control of the biological significance of the observation, the randomization should be performed in a way that preserves at least part of the actual data structure. For example, if one works on a scale free distribution and discovers biological associations within this distribution, one would not generate a shuffled set as control that would have a gaussian distribution but instead would have to preserve the scale-free distribution. In this case, no details are provided regarding what steps have been taken to ensure that the randomization preserved any of the original data structure.&nbsp;</i>P-values are computed based upon the comparison of promoter methylation between genes targeted by a miRNA A and genes not targeted by the miRNA A but targeted by any other miRNAs. Permutation was performed simply between these two sets. In this occasion, what should be conserved? I did not find anything to be conserved on this occasion. I would be happy if you can suggest it.\n<i>&gt;It is hard to believe what part of the data structure is conserved in this randomization when in the actual data between 72% to 92% of the &gt;500,000 items studied are found to be significant (Table 1) and only 3 to 6 /500,000 have that characteristic in Table 4.&nbsp;</i>I do not think that permutation can conserve anything. I would be glad if you can suggest what to be conserved.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Similarly, in Table 5 \u201cCorrelation coefficients between P-values(..)\u201d it is unclear what the numbers actually represent. I am familiar with measuring the P-value of a correlation coefficient through multiple randomly shuffled distributions to insure the significance of the observed correlation. But it is unclear to me what a correlation between P-values actually represents since they could well be associated with opposite effects.&nbsp;</i>Since I used one-sided tests as denoted in the manuscript, P-values can distinguish between opposite effects.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Finally, Figure 1 that should bear the take home message doesn't provide a better idea of what the conclusions of the paper are: the top part shows two genes targeted by different numbers of miRNA having different levels of methylation. From this it seems that the correlation found is actually between the amount of regulatory miRNA and hypomethylation, but how this was derived from table 1 and 2 is totally unclear. What happens in the boxed part of the figure is even more confusing as it shows a young cell, with 3 (expressed?) genes, becoming a senescent cell, expressing only one with methylation unchanged even though the amount of mir-548 targeting is represented higher.&nbsp;</i>\n<i>&gt;Meanwhile, the opposite is the case for the differentiation scheme. All the represented promoters (?) in the box seem to be hypomethylated regardless of the number of miRNA targeting the corresponding mRNA in total opposition to what the study seems to claim.</i>Figure 1 is just an illustration about what \u201ccan\u201d happen. Since I investigated only P-values, I cannot strictly decide what has happened exactly. There are no ways to derive Figure 1 from Table 1 and 2 directly. I think that it helps readers to imagine what is the example of what happened in the cell. If you think that it is not suitable, I will remove it.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;I think overall the methodology and lack of illustrations obfuscate the point for readers. Non-specialists and specialists alike will find it hard to follow the author\u2019s reasoning for want of clarity in the methods used. A scientific paper should strive to present the data in a way that can convince experts of the field and also explain to non specialists how the observed results lead to the presented conclusions. I feel that on both accounts this manuscript is not reaching these goals.&nbsp;</i>I hope that reading my responses, you can approve my manuscript as it is or suggest ways to revise my manuscript so as to fulfill your requirements.

Taguchi</b>; \n<i>Posted: 09 Sep 2013</i>; Thank you very much for your efforts to review my article.&nbsp;In the following, I would like to reply to your valuable comments point by point.-&nbsp;\n<i>Although this article\u2019s topic is interesting, I found that its contents were confusing and inaccessible. I also have some reservations regarding the methods.</i> \n<i>The abstract is misleading.</i> \n<i>The author states in the abstract: \u201cIt was found that promoter methylation was affected by miRNA targeting.\u201c I find this statement very misleading, as the author has not shown that miRNA targeting has an effect on promoter methylation. </i>I have modified the abstract to emphasize that what I found was not causalities but solely correlations.\n<i>- What the authors\u2019 results do suggest is that the promoters of genes that are predicted to be miRNA targets tend to be hypomethylated compared to promoters of genes predicted not to be miRNA targets. Although this correlation is an interesting observation in itself (also previously made by Su et al., 2011), the author provides no compelling evidence for miRNA targeting and regulation being the cause of (or even influence) the genes\u2019 reduced promoter methylation. Specifically, the author neither demonstrates that loss (or increase) of miRNA regulation in general nor that loss (or increase) of regulation by specific miRNAs affects promoter methylation status. Instead, the author\u2019s results indicate that predicted miRNA regulation apparently can have both a positive and negative correlation with promoter methylation status (Table 5 and Table 7). Consequently, the author\u2019s current results only support that predicted miRNA targets tend to have hypomethylated promoters in the specific cell lines used in the author\u2019s study. </i>I have recently published a paper that demonstrates miRNA-targeted-promoter methylation can be found also in human brain [PMID: 23725297]. Thus, I believe that miRNA-targeted-promoter methylation is observed not only in the specific cell lines, but also in other biological situations.\n<i>- There are no figures to illustrate analyses, show data trends, and visualize correlations.</i>I have added additional file 8 that shows the scatter plots corresponding to Tables 5 and 6.\n<i>- The author consistently presents his results as correlation coefficients and p-values. These values are important, but also hide important aspects of the data, such as the magnitude of a significant difference and the trend of or the number of observations contributing to a significant correlation. To make his results more accessible, the author should at least create a figure that compares the distributions of promoter methylation for miRNA target and non-target genes (Table 3). </i>I have added additional file 8 in order to fulfill the reviewer's requirements.\n<i>- Moreover, some of the author\u2019s analyses, such as the correlations of p-values in Tables 5-6, are fairly complex. A figure that shows the underlying data and illustrates the different steps in the analyses would make the results more accessible.</i>I have added Fig. 1 in order to fulfill the reviewer's requirements.&nbsp;\n<i>- The analyses apparently ignore miRNA expression.</i> \n<i>Presumably, a miRNA has to be expressed to have a role in gene regulation \u2013 whether that role is post-transcriptional or otherwise. It is unclear, however, whether the author takes miRNA expression into account in his analyses. For example, in Table 1, the author has apparently included all 1921 mature miRNAs from miRBase 18.0 in his analyses, but I doubt that all of these are expressed in all the 271 cell lines. One reason for including all miRNAs may be that the author has no data on which miRNAs are expressed in the different cell lines. Nevertheless, as many of the miRNAs will likely not be expressed in a given cell line, a large fraction of the 520,591 combinations tested appear irrelevant. Similarly, for the analyses presented in Table 5, where the author does have data on the miRNAs that are expressed, the author provides no information on the miRNAs actually used in the analysis. </i>In Tables 1 and 5, I have considered all miRNAs in miRBase whether they are expressed or not. I think that the amount of miRNA expression is not always a primary factor with regards to the control of miRNA regulation for the target genes. References 36 and 37 in the article support this point. In addition to this, instead of the miRNA expression, I demonstrated that miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation is related to seed region features (see Fig. 2, additional file 9, and section \u201cmiRNA-targeted-genes promoter methylation is correlated to miRNA seed region features\u201d). Although I do not intend to insist that miRNA seed region features can control miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation, I think that the amount of miRNA expression does not always have to be the only factor which controls the miRNA-regulation of target genes.\n<i>- Finally, in the last result section, the author specifically studies the miR-548 family, which has very low expression levels in the cells where it has been detected. The author seems to suggest that the predicted targets of the miR-548 family are especially likely to be hypo-methylated and concludes that \u201cRegulation of target genes by miR-548 miRNAs, which were typically expressed at low levels are likely the result of miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation.\u201d The section also contains several confusing statements such as \u201cBecause [\u2026] genes with hypomethylated promoters are expressed, the fact that promoters of target genes of miR-548 miRNAs are hypomethylated may mean that, compared to genes that are targets of other miRNAs, target genes of miR-548 miRNAs are more sensitive to changes in miRNA expression. This could explain why promoters of target genes of non-expressed miR-548 mIRNAs are specifically hypomethylated.\u201c If, for arguments sake, miRNAs really affect promoter methylation, I still fail to understand why a lowly expressed miRNA such as miR-548 should have a stronger effect than other more highly expressed miRNAs, as the author seem to suggest. Instead, I believe that the miR-548 family appear to be significantly associated with hypomethylated promoters compared with other miRNAs because of a bias in the author\u2019s analysis.</i>As mentioned above, I do not think that the amount of miRNA expression is always the only factor which controls miRNA-regulation of target genes. Apparently, miR-548 target genes have more distinct seed region features than other miRNAs. I think that this may be the reason why low amounts of miR-548 expression can be related to miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation (see Fig. 3, Table 11, and section \u201cmiRNA-targeted-genes promoter methylation is correlated to miRNA seed region features\u201d).\n<i>- Specifically, many of the members of the miR-548 family have identical seed sequences and will therefore be predicted to target the same genes (the number of unique 7mer seeds in the miR-548 family in miRBase 18.0 is 33), but the author does not seem to correct for this identical targeting in his ranking analyses (Table 9 and 10). Overall, the author should take into account both miRNA expression and similar or identical miRNA targeting in his analyses.</i>I do not think that merging seed-sharing-miRNAs into one is always the only correct way to predict miRNA regulation of target genes.

Taguchi</b>; \n<i>Posted: 16 May 2013</i>; Dear Denis,&nbsp;Thank you very much for your efforts to review my paper. Here I respond to you point by point. If these responses resolve disagreements between us and then if you can approve my manuscript, I will be happy. Alternatively, you may suggest how to revise my manuscript such that you can approve it.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;I had initially understood that the title of this study could be: &quot;Correlation between promoter methylation and miRNA regulation of target genes.&quot; Which in simpler terms could mean that miRNA targeted genes tend to have more hypomethylated promoters (or hypermethylated maybe) than expected by chance. </i> \n<i>&gt;In the current form it is still unclear to me how the data actually support this conclusion.&nbsp;</i>Unfortunately, I did not intend to conclude that \u201cmiRNA targeted genes tend to have more hypomethylated promoters (or hypermethylated maybe) than expected by chance\u201d, but tried to conclude that \u201ca set of genes targeted by a miRNA A is differently hypo/hypermethylated than a set of genes not targeted by the miRNA A but targeted by any other miRNAs\u201d. These two are very different.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The lack of illustration makes the article hard to follow, the author present the results of statistical tests without providing a clear description of what effect he is actually evaluating. And on further reading it seems that the objective of this study is largely incomprehensible to me.&nbsp;</i>What I have evaluated is, as mentioned in the main text;1.) \u201ca set of genes targeted by a miRNA A is differently hypo/hypermethylated than a set of genes not targeted by the miRNA A but targeted by any other miRNAs\u201d&nbsp;2.) \u201cthe correlation of P-values between miRNA-targeting-promoter methylation (in the sense denoted in 1.) and miRNA-mediated regulation of target genes\u201d. I also defined these two using equations, more exactly. I would be glad if you can mention in which point you are not sure.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The first question comes in the dataset compilation: how was it done and what were the criteria used to accept or reject data used in the study? </i> \n<i>&gt;A figure representing the process of dataset generation would be welcome.&nbsp;</i>As I have mentioned in the Methods section (mRNA and miRNA expression profiles), what I have done is to just make mean and variance, zero and one, respectively. I have never done any other treatments. Thus, I assumed that no detailed explanations were required. If I was not correct, please advise me about how to to prepare suitable figures.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The author states: \u201cI tested profiles from this dataset to confirm that obtained results were not research group dependent.\u201d How was this done? It is well known that biological experiments on a genome scale are inherently noisy so results even within the same group will not be the exact replicate of one another. What was considered acceptable to create a dataset compendium? Was any normalization applied? Was there an a posteriori check that the independent sets were behaving in the same way as the compendium? If not, would the same conclusion have been obtained by analyzing them separately? Is only part of the data driving the conclusion and can it be explained by the different cell lines?&nbsp;</i>I have compared one experiment with another experiment, only using the correlation coefficients of P-values. Almost all analyses were performed in P-value based. As you pointed out, raw values like gene expression and promoter methylation are hard to compare between different experiments. All success in this study is achieved by the employment of P-value based approaches.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Elsewhere, the author states \u201cIt should be noted that genes that were not the targets of any miRNAs were totally excluded from the analysis\u201d which makes me think that I totally missed the initial point of this work as I thought the objective was to test the hypothesis that promoter methylation status was related to miRNA targeting of the produced messenger. In this, genes that are not targets of miRNA would be useful as a control group.</i>\n<i>&gt;Even if the author is trying to demonstrate a relationship between the amount of miRNA regulation and methylation, non-target genes would be an essential control.&nbsp;</i>As I have mentioned above, the purpose of this study was to compare promoter methylation between genes targeted by different miRNAs. Thus, non-target genes cannot be any controls in this context. However, since you require me to clearly&nbsp;point&nbsp;this&nbsp;out, I show this in Table 3.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The second question arises from the choice of the values used for methylation. The author states: \u201cI employed a method in which total methylation values were used(..) because I found that P-values computed when using methylation data were more strongly correlated to the P-values calculated from target gene miRNA regulation data, which is likely due to the fact that the frequency of CpGs is also related to miRNA targeting\u201d&nbsp;</i>\n<i>&gt;and later:&nbsp;</i>\n<i>&gt;\u201c\u03b2i was the ratio of methylated sites to unmethylated sites, (...) were deposited in the public datasets used, their use could not be avoided; however, as a result, the correlation with target gene miRNA regulation was substantially decreased. An explanation for this is noted above.\u201d&nbsp; </i>\n<i>&gt;\u201cObtaining a better P-value\u201d, is not an acceptable rationale for changing the way the methylation of a promoter is \u201ctypically represented\u201d.&nbsp;</i>I did not insist that \u201cObtaining a better P-value\u201d is the criterion to choose which definition of methylation should be employed. I wrote that better correlation of P-values between miRNA-targeting-specific promoter methylation and miRNA regulation of target genes is the criterion to choose which definition of methylation should be employed.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;The reason why the association between CpG island associated genes and miRNA targeting explains the difference in P-values between using total methylation values and proportion of methylated sites, is not obvious. It hints at a different behavior between CpG and non CpG promoters, would it not then make sense to process them separately?&nbsp;</i>As I have mentioned in the manuscript, there are some differences. However, the correlation between P-values for miRNA-targeting-specific promoter methylation and P-values for miRNA-mediated regulation of target genes is significant. In fact, for GSM739940, I had to employ \u03b2-values, but the correlation is still significant (see Table 6). Thus, I think that selection of values that represent promoter methylation to be investigated is not essential for the purpose of this manuscript. If you think that you need more evaluations, please advise me about what kind of evaluation is useful for you to be satisfied.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;It seems that the two ways of representing the data mean very different things and that decision could greatly affect the conclusions that can be extracted from the results. If I understand correctly, with the absolute number method a promoter with 2/3 methylated sites would be counted the same as a 2/10 yet in one case one could consider the first to be 66% methylated and the other 20%. The implication of this choice on the results of the study should be discussed more thoroughly.&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the above, since both ratio and amount of methylation work more or less well, I do not think that \u201cdecision could greatly affect the conclusions\u201d. However, if you can suggest some kind of additional evaluations, I am happy to perform this so as to fulfill your requirements.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;In table 1, if the top part is indeed calculated with ratio and bottom with absolute, what were the thresholds to be counted as hypomethylated in each case?&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the text, I employed P-values to check if the promoters are hyper/hypomethylated. Threshold of P-values is, as denoted in the manuscript, P&lt;0.05 after adjusted based on BH criterion.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;What does the \u201cnumber of miRNA\u201d actually represent? The author indicates that he multiplied the number of miRNA (1971) by the number of cell lines included (271). What does this product represent in the end? Why were the datapoints not aggregated by promoter and/or miRNA in the context of this study?&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the manuscript, P-values are attributed not to each gene but to each miRNA. Thus, in the framework of the present study, it is impossible to attribute P-values to each promoter. Also, P-values are attributed to miRNAs in each cell line, because each cell line has a different pattern of promoter methylation. Thus, in some cell lines a miRNA's target genes' promoters are significantly hyper/hypomethylated, while they may not be in other cell lines. Thus, to each miRNA, the number of P-values attributed is the number of cell line. Thus, I get the number of cell lines times number of miRNAs P-values in total.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Table 3 for example is symptomatic of how the lack of illustration makes the article hard to follow: \u201cP-values that represent the difference of promoter methylation between miRNA target genes and miRNA non-target genes.\u201d The P-value doesn't represent a \u201cdifference in promoter methylation\u201d, it evaluates the likelihood of the observation happening by chance given the dataset distribution. But what is the observation here? Are promoters of genes targeted by miRNA 60% methylated vs 58% for the non targeted? (is it 10 vs 87?)&nbsp;</i>It depends upon the statistical test employed, since I used three statistical tests. For the t-test, your expectation is more or less true, since the t-test compares mean values between two sets (although I used amount of methylation, not ratio, as denoted in the text) . For other tests, other statistical values are used in order to check significant difference.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Are we considering a very slight effect with a very strong statistical significance or a very obvious strong effect for which the statistical test is not even needed to be convinced of the solidity of the result?&nbsp;</i>As I have written in the above, the essence of this study is to consider the correlation of P-values. This is the only useful variable to compare different experiments. Thus, I cannot answer your question. Using only P-values, I cannot distinguish between two cases:\u201ca very slight effect with a very strong statistical significance\u201d and \u201ca very obvious strong effect for which the statistical test is not even needed to be convinced of the solidity of the result\u201d, but considering other variables make the comparison between the different experiments impossible, as you suggested in the above. However, as I have mentioned in the above, employment of P-value based analyses is essential to derive conclusions in this paper.\n<i>&gt;Moreover, just below that table the author explains why he doesn't discriminate between hypo and hypermethylation of promoters. That makes table 3 very puzzling; is this P-value evaluating the likelihood of miRNA targeted gene promoters to be significantly BOTH over and/or under methylated relative to non-targeted genes?&nbsp;</i>Yes, I did not distinguish between these two cases. However, if you wish, it is not difficult to investigate it if I used a one-sided test.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Table 4 has been added as a response to my previous comment however it seems to bring further question as to what \u201cmiRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation\u201d really means. My first comment is that this control should not constitute a separate table but an additional entry in the original table.&nbsp;</i>I am not sure what kind of information you need. Please advise me what to do.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Secondly, there are many ways to generate random shuffling of the data that will destroy the \u201csignal\u201d, however for a random shuffling to be a valid control of the biological significance of the observation, the randomization should be performed in a way that preserves at least part of the actual data structure. For example, if one works on a scale free distribution and discovers biological associations within this distribution, one would not generate a shuffled set as control that would have a gaussian distribution but instead would have to preserve the scale-free distribution. In this case, no details are provided regarding what steps have been taken to ensure that the randomization preserved any of the original data structure.&nbsp;</i>P-values are computed based upon the comparison of promoter methylation between genes targeted by a miRNA A and genes not targeted by the miRNA A but targeted by any other miRNAs. Permutation was performed simply between these two sets. In this occasion, what should be conserved? I did not find anything to be conserved on this occasion. I would be happy if you can suggest it.\n<i>&gt;It is hard to believe what part of the data structure is conserved in this randomization when in the actual data between 72% to 92% of the &gt;500,000 items studied are found to be significant (Table 1) and only 3 to 6 /500,000 have that characteristic in Table 4.&nbsp;</i>I do not think that permutation can conserve anything. I would be glad if you can suggest what to be conserved.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Similarly, in Table 5 \u201cCorrelation coefficients between P-values(..)\u201d it is unclear what the numbers actually represent. I am familiar with measuring the P-value of a correlation coefficient through multiple randomly shuffled distributions to insure the significance of the observed correlation. But it is unclear to me what a correlation between P-values actually represents since they could well be associated with opposite effects.&nbsp;</i>Since I used one-sided tests as denoted in the manuscript, P-values can distinguish between opposite effects.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;Finally, Figure 1 that should bear the take home message doesn't provide a better idea of what the conclusions of the paper are: the top part shows two genes targeted by different numbers of miRNA having different levels of methylation. From this it seems that the correlation found is actually between the amount of regulatory miRNA and hypomethylation, but how this was derived from table 1 and 2 is totally unclear. What happens in the boxed part of the figure is even more confusing as it shows a young cell, with 3 (expressed?) genes, becoming a senescent cell, expressing only one with methylation unchanged even though the amount of mir-548 targeting is represented higher.&nbsp;</i>\n<i>&gt;Meanwhile, the opposite is the case for the differentiation scheme. All the represented promoters (?) in the box seem to be hypomethylated regardless of the number of miRNA targeting the corresponding mRNA in total opposition to what the study seems to claim.</i>Figure 1 is just an illustration about what \u201ccan\u201d happen. Since I investigated only P-values, I cannot strictly decide what has happened exactly. There are no ways to derive Figure 1 from Table 1 and 2 directly. I think that it helps readers to imagine what is the example of what happened in the cell. If you think that it is not suitable, I will remove it.&nbsp;\n<i>&gt;I think overall the methodology and lack of illustrations obfuscate the point for readers. Non-specialists and specialists alike will find it hard to follow the author\u2019s reasoning for want of clarity in the methods used. A scientific paper should strive to present the data in a way that can convince experts of the field and also explain to non specialists how the observed results lead to the presented conclusions. I feel that on both accounts this manuscript is not reaching these goals.&nbsp;</i>I hope that reading my responses, you can approve my manuscript as it is or suggest ways to revise my manuscript so as to fulfill your requirements.

Taguchi</b>; \n<i>Posted: 09 Sep 2013</i>; Thank you very much for your efforts to review my article.&nbsp;In the following, I would like to reply to your valuable comments point by point.-&nbsp;\n<i>Although this article\u2019s topic is interesting, I found that its contents were confusing and inaccessible. I also have some reservations regarding the methods.</i> \n<i>The abstract is misleading.</i> \n<i>The author states in the abstract: \u201cIt was found that promoter methylation was affected by miRNA targeting.\u201c I find this statement very misleading, as the author has not shown that miRNA targeting has an effect on promoter methylation. </i>I have modified the abstract to emphasize that what I found was not causalities but solely correlations.\n<i>- What the authors\u2019 results do suggest is that the promoters of genes that are predicted to be miRNA targets tend to be hypomethylated compared to promoters of genes predicted not to be miRNA targets. Although this correlation is an interesting observation in itself (also previously made by Su et al., 2011), the author provides no compelling evidence for miRNA targeting and regulation being the cause of (or even influence) the genes\u2019 reduced promoter methylation. Specifically, the author neither demonstrates that loss (or increase) of miRNA regulation in general nor that loss (or increase) of regulation by specific miRNAs affects promoter methylation status. Instead, the author\u2019s results indicate that predicted miRNA regulation apparently can have both a positive and negative correlation with promoter methylation status (Table 5 and Table 7). Consequently, the author\u2019s current results only support that predicted miRNA targets tend to have hypomethylated promoters in the specific cell lines used in the author\u2019s study. </i>I have recently published a paper that demonstrates miRNA-targeted-promoter methylation can be found also in human brain [PMID: 23725297]. Thus, I believe that miRNA-targeted-promoter methylation is observed not only in the specific cell lines, but also in other biological situations.\n<i>- There are no figures to illustrate analyses, show data trends, and visualize correlations.</i>I have added additional file 8 that shows the scatter plots corresponding to Tables 5 and 6.\n<i>- The author consistently presents his results as correlation coefficients and p-values. These values are important, but also hide important aspects of the data, such as the magnitude of a significant difference and the trend of or the number of observations contributing to a significant correlation. To make his results more accessible, the author should at least create a figure that compares the distributions of promoter methylation for miRNA target and non-target genes (Table 3). </i>I have added additional file 8 in order to fulfill the reviewer's requirements.\n<i>- Moreover, some of the author\u2019s analyses, such as the correlations of p-values in Tables 5-6, are fairly complex. A figure that shows the underlying data and illustrates the different steps in the analyses would make the results more accessible.</i>I have added Fig. 1 in order to fulfill the reviewer's requirements.&nbsp;\n<i>- The analyses apparently ignore miRNA expression.</i> \n<i>Presumably, a miRNA has to be expressed to have a role in gene regulation \u2013 whether that role is post-transcriptional or otherwise. It is unclear, however, whether the author takes miRNA expression into account in his analyses. For example, in Table 1, the author has apparently included all 1921 mature miRNAs from miRBase 18.0 in his analyses, but I doubt that all of these are expressed in all the 271 cell lines. One reason for including all miRNAs may be that the author has no data on which miRNAs are expressed in the different cell lines. Nevertheless, as many of the miRNAs will likely not be expressed in a given cell line, a large fraction of the 520,591 combinations tested appear irrelevant. Similarly, for the analyses presented in Table 5, where the author does have data on the miRNAs that are expressed, the author provides no information on the miRNAs actually used in the analysis. </i>In Tables 1 and 5, I have considered all miRNAs in miRBase whether they are expressed or not. I think that the amount of miRNA expression is not always a primary factor with regards to the control of miRNA regulation for the target genes. References 36 and 37 in the article support this point. In addition to this, instead of the miRNA expression, I demonstrated that miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation is related to seed region features (see Fig. 2, additional file 9, and section \u201cmiRNA-targeted-genes promoter methylation is correlated to miRNA seed region features\u201d). Although I do not intend to insist that miRNA seed region features can control miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation, I think that the amount of miRNA expression does not always have to be the only factor which controls the miRNA-regulation of target genes.\n<i>- Finally, in the last result section, the author specifically studies the miR-548 family, which has very low expression levels in the cells where it has been detected. The author seems to suggest that the predicted targets of the miR-548 family are especially likely to be hypo-methylated and concludes that \u201cRegulation of target genes by miR-548 miRNAs, which were typically expressed at low levels are likely the result of miRNA-targeted-gene promoter hypomethylation.\u201d The section also contains several confusing statements such as \u201cBecause [\u2026] genes with hypomethylated promoters are expressed, the fact that promoters of target genes of miR-548 miRNAs are hypomethylated may mean that, compared to genes that are targets of other miRNAs, target genes of miR-548 miRNAs are more sensitive to changes in miRNA expression. This could explain why promoters of target genes of non-expressed miR-548 mIRNAs are specifically hypomethylated.\u201c If, for arguments sake, miRNAs really affect promoter methylation, I still fail to understand why a lowly expressed miRNA such as miR-548 should have a stronger effect than other more highly expressed miRNAs, as the author seem to suggest. Instead, I believe that the miR-548 family appear to be significantly associated with hypomethylated promoters compared with other miRNAs because of a bias in the author\u2019s analysis.</i>As mentioned above, I do not think that the amount of miRNA expression is always the only factor which controls miRNA-regulation of target genes. Apparently, miR-548 target genes have more distinct seed region features than other miRNAs. I think that this may be the reason why low amounts of miR-548 expression can be related to miRNA-targeted-gene promoter methylation (see Fig. 3, Table 11, and section \u201cmiRNA-targeted-genes promoter methylation is correlated to miRNA seed region features\u201d).\n<i>- Specifically, many of the members of the miR-548 family have identical seed sequences and will therefore be predicted to target the same genes (the number of unique 7mer seeds in the miR-548 family in miRBase 18.0 is 33), but the author does not seem to correct for this identical targeting in his ranking analyses (Table 9 and 10). Overall, the author should take into account both miRNA expression and similar or identical miRNA targeting in his analyses.</i>I do not think that merging seed-sharing-miRNAs into one is always the only correct way to predict miRNA regulation of target genes. Please see the newly added section \u201cTreatment of shared miRNA seed sequences\u201d and Appendix. In addition to this, my MiRaGE method - which does not merge seed-sharing-miRNAs into one - was applied to many biological processes, and I found that it works reasonably well (see References 15, 16, and 21 from the article).I would like to thank the reviewer, whose comments have greatly improved the quality of this paper.
