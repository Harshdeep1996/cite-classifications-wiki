These responses do not occur in a medium containing Ca2+ in the physiological range (1 to 2 mmol/L). Experiments were done to determine whether feedback amplification is required to generate amounts of TXA2 that are sufficient to cause secondary aggregation and the reactions associated with it, or whether close platelet-to-platelet contact alone is sufficient to generate enough TXA2 to produce these responses. Platelets were washed and resuspended in a modified Tyrode solution to which no calcium salt was added that contained 0.35% albumin and apyrase. This medium contains 20 mumol/L Ca2+ and 1 mmol/L Mg2+. Platelets were aggregated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the presence of fibrinogen, agglutinated with polylysine, or after pretreatment with chymotrypsin, aggregated with fibrinogen. In the low- Ca2+ medium, all these agonists caused platelets to adhere to each other, followed by secondary aggregation with TXA2 formation and release of granule contents. When Ca2+ (1 to 2 mmol/L), aspirin, or the thromboxane receptor blocker BM 13.177 was present, the secondary responses did not occur; dazoxiben decreased thromboxane formation, but did not prevent secondary aggregation or release. Aspirin-treated platelets were less responsive to ADP, U46619, or TXA2 in the low-Ca2+ medium, which indicated that the secondary responses of untreated platelets were not caused by a generalized increase in sensitivity. The reactions that result from close platelet-to-platelet contact in a low- Ca2+ medium can be caused by a wide variety of weak agonists; the secondary aggregation response and release of granule contents are dependent on TXA2 formation and on feedback amplification by TXA2 or the prostaglandin endoperoxides.

These responses do not occur in a medium containing Ca2+ in the physiological range (1 to 2 mmol/L). Experiments were done to determine whether feedback amplification is required to generate amounts of TXA2 that are sufficient to cause secondary aggregation and the reactions associated with it, or whether close platelet-to-platelet contact alone is sufficient to generate enough TXA2 to produce these responses. Platelets were washed and resuspended in a modified Tyrode solution to which no calcium salt was added that contained 0.35% albumin and apyrase. This medium contains 20 mumol/L Ca2+ and 1 mmol/L Mg2+. Platelets were aggregated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the presence of fibrinogen, agglutinated with polylysine, or after pretreatment with chymotrypsin, aggregated with fibrinogen. In the low- Ca2+ medium, all these agonists caused platelets to adhere to each other, followed by secondary aggregation with TXA2 formation and release of granule contents. When Ca2+ (1 to 2 mmol/L), aspirin, or the thromboxane receptor blocker BM 13.177 was present, the secondary responses did not occur; dazoxiben decreased thromboxane formation, but did not prevent secondary aggregation or release. Aspirin-treated platelets were less responsive to ADP, U46619, or TXA2 in the low-Ca2+ medium, which indicated that the secondary responses of untreated platelets were not caused by a generalized increase in sensitivity. The reactions that result from close platelet-to-platelet contact in a low- Ca2+ medium can be caused by a wide variety of weak agonists; the secondary aggregation response and release of granule contents are dependent on TXA2 formation and on feedback amplification by TXA2 or the prostaglandin endoperoxides. The secondary responses caused by weak agonists in citrated platelet-rich plasma (which has a concentration of Ca2+ similar to the low-Ca2+ medium used in the present studies) do not occur at the
