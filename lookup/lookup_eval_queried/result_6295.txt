Stromal elements were obtained from slices of cancellous bone. PH bone marrow stroma contained CFU-GM concentrations similar to aspirated PH marrow and significantly more CFU-GM than DNH bone marrow: 20.7 +/- 4.8/10(5) cells and 25.8 +/- 12.0/mg bone versus 0.81 +/- 0.34/10(5) cells and 0.02 +/- 0.01/mg bone (p less than 0.001). Conditioned media prepared from PH and DNH bone were quantitated for CSA by their ability to promote in vitro granulocyte colony formation of nonadherent human marrow cells. Stromal CSA production was destroyed by freeze--thawing and was radioresistant (4400 rad). Of DNH stromal cells, 15%--30% were monocyte-macrophage, but the slow absolute numbers of these cells suggested alternative CSA cellular sources in distal bones. PH stroma produced significantly more CSA than DNH bone stroma: 0.72 +/- 0.10 versus 0.30 +/- 0.06 U/mg bone (p less than 0.01).

Stromal elements were obtained from slices of cancellous bone. PH bone marrow stroma contained CFU-GM concentrations similar to aspirated PH marrow and significantly more CFU-GM than DNH bone marrow: 20.7 +/- 4.8/10(5) cells and 25.8 +/- 12.0/mg bone versus 0.81 +/- 0.34/10(5) cells and 0.02 +/- 0.01/mg bone (p less than 0.001). Conditioned media prepared from PH and DNH bone were quantitated for CSA by their ability to promote in vitro granulocyte colony formation of nonadherent human marrow cells. Stromal CSA production was destroyed by freeze--thawing and was radioresistant (4400 rad). Of DNH stromal cells, 15%--30% were monocyte-macrophage, but the slow absolute numbers of these cells suggested alternative CSA cellular sources in distal bones.

Autologous bone marrow (BM) transplantation is being explored as a treatment modality designed to improve relapse-free survival. We have conducted a phase II trial exploring the combination of busulfan (16 mg/kg) and etoposide (60 mg/kg) in an attempt to improve antitumor efficacy using this novel preparative regimen. To date, 50 patients (48 with ANLL and 2 patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia) have been treated. The first 20 patients received unmanipulated BM; 28 patients subsequently received 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4\u2013HC) (60 micrograms/mL)-purged bone marrow, and 2 patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia received both 4\u2013HC (60 micrograms/mL) and etoposide (5 micrograms/mL)-purged BM. Thirty-four patients were in first complete remission (CR1), 12 patients in second complete remission (CR2), and 4 patients in relapse. The median time from first complete remission to BM harvest was 3 months (range, 0.8 to 4) compared with median time of 2 months (range, 1.5 to 5.0) for patients in second complete remission. The median time from harvest to transplant was 1 month for both groups (range, 0.4 to 36). A median of 0.7 x 10(8) (range, 0.2 to 1.4) mononuclear cells were infused.

Twenty-six patients are alive and in continued CR. Follow-up of the surviving patients ranged from 6 months to 66 months with a median follow-up of 31 months.

The most significant extramedullary toxicities for this regimen are hepatic and cutaneous (including mucositis). The BU/VP-16 regimen is associated with a significant proportion of patients surviving disease free, especially in the group receiving purged BM.

Despite this striking affiliation, surprisingly little is known about the precise cellular and molecular impact of osteoblasts on the bone marrow microenvironment. Recently, we showed that human osteoblasts produce a variety of cytokine mRNAs including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-6. We examined here the ability of osteoblasts to support the development of hematopoietic colonies from progenitors as well the ability to maintain long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) in vitro. Examination of the hematopoietic cells recovered after 2 weeks of culture showed that osteoblasts support the maintenance of immature hematopoietic phenotypes. In methylcellulose assays, osteoblasts stimulate the development of hematopoietic colonies to a level at least 10-fold over controls from progenitor cells. Using limiting dilutional bone marrow cultures, we observed an activity produced by osteoblasts resulting in an threefold to fourfold expansion of human LTC-IC and progenitor cells in vitro. Thus, the presence of hematopoietic stem cells in close proximity to endosteal surfaces in vivo may be due in part to a requirement for osteoblast-derived products.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v87.2.518.bloodjournal872518", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 11]], "date-time": "2019-10-11T11:11:56Z", "timestamp": 1570792316000}, "page": "518-524", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 31, "title": ["Human osteoblasts support human hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro bone marrow cultures"], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "87", "author": [{"given": "RS", "family": "Taichman", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Periodontics, School of Dentistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109\u20131078, USA."}]}, {"given": "MJ", "family": "Reilly", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Periodontics, School of Dentistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109\u20131078, USA."}]}, {"given": "SG", "family": "Emerson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Periodontics, School of Dentistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109\u20131078, USA."}]}], "member": "234", "container-title": ["Blood"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/87/2/518/619563/518.pdf", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "syndication"}, {"URL": "http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/87/2/518/619563/518.pdf", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2019-11-17T23:17:16Z", "timestamp": 1574032636000}, "score": 21.457989, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1996, 1, 15]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1996, 1, 15]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v87.2.518.bloodjournal872518", "ISSN": ["0006-4971", "1528-0020"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0006-4971", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1528-0020", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["Immunology", "Cell Biology", "Biochemistry", "Hematology"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 5]], "date-time": "2019-12-05T07:01:09Z", "timestamp": 1575529269207}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "American Society of Hematology", "issue": "4", "content-domain": {"domain": ["ashpublications.org"], "crossmark-restriction": true}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1996, 2, 15]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p>CD34 is expressed by essentially all human hematopoietic progenitors including cells of the megakaryocyte (MK) lineage. We have previously reported CD4 expression by some human MK (Blood 81:2,664, 1993). To study the role of maturation on CD4 expression by MK, we examined CD34+ bone marrow cells for their expression of CD41 (GPIIb-GPIIIa) and CD4 with specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb)-fluorochrome conjugates and for DNA polyploidization with propidium iodide or 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD). Surprisingly, MK were at least 20-fold more common in the CD34+ progenitor pool (approximately 10%) than in the more mature CD34+ population (approximately 0.5%) of low density bone marrow cells. CD4 expression correlated with markers of immaturity in that CD4 was enriched among CD34+ cells, and the proportion of CD4+ MK declined with increasing ploidy. Almost all CD34+ polyploid ( &gt; or = 8N) cells were CD4+. Despite these correlations with immaturity, CD34+CD4+ MK precursors were unable to produce MK colony-forming units (CFU-MK) when cultured under conditions that supported the growth of CFU-MK from CD34+CD4- MK lineage cells. MK became polyploid before the loss of either CD34 or CD4 expression. The presence of CD4 on these cells correlates with the onset of endomitotic reduplication and is associated with the loss of the ability of these cells to undergo normal mitotic division. The role of CD4 on immature MK as a differentiation antigen and/or receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 virus remains to be determined.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v87.4.1353.bloodjournal8741353", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 11]], "date-time": "2019-10-11T18:41:24Z", "timestamp": 1570819284000}, "page": "1353-1360", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 11, "title": ["Development of human megakaryocytes: I.
