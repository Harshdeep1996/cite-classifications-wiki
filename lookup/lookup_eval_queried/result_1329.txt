Corporate policy dictates ongoing improvement of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in order to meet or surpass regulatory requirements. Environmental objectives are reviewed annually and programs are modified when necessary to address improvements in environmental performance. Manitoba Hydro plans and constructs major transmission projects throughout northern Manitoba which includes areas occupied by boreal woodland caribou. In recognition of the potential issues associated with hydro transmission construction in boreal caribou range, Manitoba Hydro hosted an expert workshop on May 8, 2007 to provide objective advice in the development of a draft corporate strategy that effectively directs targeted monitoring and research for environmental assessment and mitigation. The workshop focused on assessing the potential threats to boreal woodland caribou from a transmission line construction and operation perspective, and identifying appropriate approaches in site selection and environmental assessment (SSEA) and long-term monitoring and research. A total of nine threat categories were reviewed to determine the degree and magnitude of potential effects that may result from transmission construction and operation; and of the original nine, five final threat categories were delineated. The main elements of the workshop provided strategic approaches for proactive pre-construction monitoring, research on recruitment and mortality for local populations impacted by ROWs and control areas, and various habitat monitoring, management, and mitigation techniques. Research and monitoring priorities have been identified and continued collaboration with Manitoba Conservation and other land users were also identified.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.7557/2.32.2.2259", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 2, 25]], "date-time": "2013-02-25T07:22:15Z", "timestamp": 1361776935000}, "page": "115", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Towards a Manitoba Hydro boreal woodland caribou strategy: Outcomes from Manitoba Hydro boreal woodland caribou workshop"], "prefix": "10.7557", "volume": "32", "author": [{"given": "Fiona E.", "family": "Scurrah", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Doug W.", "family": "Schindler", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "4421", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 8]]}, "container-title": ["Rangifer"], "link": [{"URL": "https://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/rangifer/article/viewFile/2259/2102", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/rangifer/article/viewFile/2259/2102", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 7]], "date-time": "2019-03-07T14:42:49Z", "timestamp": 1551969769000}, "score": 16.836075, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 8]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 6]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/2.32.2.2259", "ISSN": ["1890-6729"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1890-6729", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T05:55:48Z", "timestamp": 1574488548300}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Consortium Erudit", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["\u00c9tudes/Inuit/Studies"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2002]]}, "DOI": "10.7202/007652ar", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 7, 17]], "date-time": "2012-07-17T06:52:56Z", "timestamp": 1342507976000}, "page": "190", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Guldager, Ole, Steffen Stummann Hansen and Simon Gleie 2002 Medieval Farmsteads in Greenland \u2014 The Brattahlid region 1999-2000, Copenhagen, Danish Polar Center."], "prefix": "10.7202", "volume": "26", "author": [{"given": "Charles E.", "family": "Schweger", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "4194", "container-title": ["\u00c9tudes/Inuit/Studies"], "language": "fr", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2012, 7, 17]], "date-time": "2012-07-17T07:08:01Z", "timestamp": 1342508881000}, "score": 16.716438, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2002]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/007652ar", "ISSN": ["0701-1008", "1708-5268"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0701-1008", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1708-5268", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T05:54:07Z", "timestamp": 1574488447097}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Consortium Erudit", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["\u00c9tudes/Inuit/Studies"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010]]}, "DOI": "10.7202/1004109ar", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 7, 16]], "date-time": "2012-07-16T23:47:36Z", "timestamp": 1342482456000}, "page": "189", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["EVANS, Michael Robert, 2010 The Fast Runner: Filming the Legend of Atanarjuat, Lincoln and London, University of Nebraska Press, 162 pages."], "prefix": "10.7202", "volume": "34", "author": [{"given": "Emily E.", "family": "Auger", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "4194", "container-title": ["\u00c9tudes/Inuit/Studies"], "language": "fr", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2012, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2012-11-27T16:56:21Z", "timestamp": 1354035381000}, "score": 16.716438, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/1004109ar", "ISSN": ["0701-1008", "1708-5268"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0701-1008", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1708-5268", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T19:33:17Z", "timestamp": 1574796797412}, "reference-count": 71, "publisher": "Consortium Erudit", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["etudinuit"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Early Euro-Inuit contacts in Atlantic Canada raise a complex issue in the ethnohistory of resource exploitation. In the 16th\u00a0century, Breton, Norman, and Basque crews developed a seasonal salt-cod fishery on the coasts of northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador, in about the same period that the Inuit moved southwards along the Labrador coast. The Basques also exploited the Strait of Belle Isle, between Newfoundland and Labrador, for shore-based whaling. Sometime before 1620, Europeans then appear to have withdrawn from Labrador until about 1680, when Canadian merchants based in Quebec began to exploit the Strait for salmon and seals, while French migratory crews edged northwards again from Newfoundland. European withdrawal from Labrador largely coincided with a long-running guerrilla war, waged by the Inuit against Breton and Basque fishermen exploiting Newfoundland\u2019s Great Northern Peninsula. The chronological coincidence suggests that the movement of Inuit into southern Labrador by the end of the 16th\u00a0century may well have motivated Europeans to avoid this coast through much of the 17th\u00a0century. French attitudes to the Labrador Inuit can be contextualized by comparison with contemporary understandings of Euro-Inuit relations elsewhere. Inuit attitudes to Europeans are harder to assess but recognition of their struggle for access to resources is a step towards an appreciation of historical Inuit agency.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.7202/1036076ar", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 16]], "date-time": "2016-05-16T13:45:41Z", "timestamp": 1463406341000}, "page": "15-36", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Bretons, Basques, and Inuit in Labrador and northern Newfoundland: The control of maritime resources in the 16th and 17th centuries"], "prefix": "10.7202", "volume": "39", "author": [{"given": "Peter E.", "family": "Pope", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Department of Archaeology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland and Labrador A1C 5S7, Canada"}]}], "member": "4194", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 4, 1]]}, "reference": [{"key": "rb1", "unstructured": "ANONYMOUS [probably Claude-Charles Le Roy Bacqueville de La Potherie], n.d.[ca. 1697] Detroit de la Baye d\u2019Hudson, manuscript, Aix-en-Provence, Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer, 3DFC/6/80 f. 34-46v."}, {"key": "rb2", "unstructured": "GRAVES, Thomas, 1762 Letter to the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, 29 November\u00a01762, UK National Archives, CO 194/15, ff. 45-46v, microfilm on file, St. John\u2019s, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Centre for Newfoundland Studies."}, {"key": "rb3", "unstructured": "HURIAU, Thomas, 1687 Rapport de capitaine, November\u00a01687, Rennes, Archives d\u00e9partementales d\u2019Ille-et-Vilaine, Amiraut\u00e9 de Saint Malo, 9B.196, 48."}, {"key": "rb4", "unstructured": "KIRKE, David, 1639 Letter to Archbishop Laud, 2 October\u00a01639, UK National Archives, CO 1/10 (40), 119, photocopy on file, St. John\u2019s, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Maritime History Archive."}, {"key": "rb5", "unstructured": "NARP, Philibert de, 1669 Memoire agnaux 1669 Terre Neuve mine de plomb, Aix-en-Provence, Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer, AC, C11C vol.\u00a01, f. 29-30, Ottawa, Library and Archives Canada, microfilm 498."}, {"key": "rb6", "unstructured": "LOUIS XV [of France], 1734 Ordonnance du Roy, 16 February\u00a01734, Aix-en-Provence, Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer, F/3/54, f. 459-460."}, {"key": "rb7", "unstructured": "PARLEMENT DE BRETAGNE, 1640 Arrest de la Cour de Parlement de Bretagne\u2026 sur les r\u00e8glemens du navires et gallays aux partyes de Terre Neuve, 31 March\u00a01640, France, Archives de Colonies, F3, vol.\u00a054, 248-51v, Ottawa, Library and Archives Canada, microfilm 564."}, {"key": "rb8", "unstructured": "BACQUEVILLE DE LA POTHERIE, Claude-Charles Le Roy, 1722 Histoire de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique septentrionale, tome\u00a01, Paris, Jean-Luc Nion and Fran\u00e7ois Didot."}, {"key": "rb9", "unstructured": "BAKKER, Peter, 1989 \u201cThe language of the coast tribes is half Basque\u201d: A Basque-American Indian pidgin in use between Europeans and Native Americans in North America, ca. 1540-ca. 1640, Anthropological Linguistics,\u00a031(3-4): 117-147."}, {"key": "rb10", "unstructured": "BAKKER, Peter, 1991 Trade Languages in the Strait of Belle Isle, Journal of the Atlantic Provinces Linguistic Association, 13: 1-20."}, {"key": "rb11", "unstructured": "BARKHAM, Selma, 1980 A note on the Strait of Belle Isle during the period of Basque contact with Indians and Inuit, \u00c9tudes/Inuit/Studies, 4(1-2): 51-58."}, {"key": "rb12", "unstructured": "BAKKER, Peter, 1982 The documentary evidence for Basque whaling ships in the Strait of Belle Isle, in G.M.

A total maximum population estimate of woodland caribou west of the Ontario/Manitoba border is 61 090. Of 44 herds or populations described in this review: 14 are stable; two are stable to slightly decreasing; four are decreasing; four are increasing; and 22 are of unknown status. Caribou are classified as a threatened species in Alberta and as an endangered species in Washington/Idaho. The decline of caribou in North America following settlement (Bergerud, 1974) has continued along the southern edge of woodland caribou distribution. Direct loss of habitat to logging, mines and dams continued throughout the I960s, 1970s and 1980s. The secondary effects of these habitat changes, (i.e. increased roads leading to increased hunting and poaching, and increased early succession habitat leading to increased alternate prey/predator densities) has led in some cases to the total loss or decreased size of local herds. Three ecotypes of woodland caribou are described and their relative distribution delineated. These ecotypes live under different environmental conditions and require different inventory and management approaches. Woodland caribou herds in northern B.C., Yukon and N.W.T. generally are of good numbers and viable (stable or increasing), and management primarily is directed at regulating human harvest and natural predation to prevent, herd declines. Land use activities such as logging or energy development are not extensive. Managers in southern caribou ranges stress the need for a better understanding of caribou population stability within mixed prey/predator regimes; how habitat changes (eg. through logging) affect these regimes; and how to develop effective land use guidelines for resource extraction that can sustian caribou populations and maintain resource industries. Caribou managers have suggested that herds may be priorized for research and management efforts. Unstable, remnant populations may be left to their own fate. The limited research dollars available and difficult management decisions should be applied to caribou herds that are apparently sustainable and provide the greatest potential for long-term viability.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.7557/2.11.4.998", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 2, 25]], "date-time": "2013-02-25T07:29:49Z", "timestamp": 1361777389000}, "page": "91", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 7, "title": ["Status of woodland caribou in western north America"], "prefix": "10.7557", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "E.

Based upon nutritional value, the use of different habitats can be predicted, including how factors such as insect harassment, predation and migration might modify habitat selection. If habitat value and use can be understood, then changes in habitat availability which are of concern to wildlife managers can be assessed. The theory is used to address diet choice and habitat use of caribou/reindeer. Diet choice is examined in terms of lichen composition of the diet and is demonstrated to be a function of daily feeding time, food abundance and digestive capacity. The diet choice model is then used to assess the nutritional profitability of different habitats and which habitat should be preferred based upon nutritional profitability. Caribou/reindeer use of habitats is demonstrated to be easily modified by insect harassment and predation which change the nutritional profitability of habitats differentially. The same type of approach could be used to explain migratory behaviour; however, the needed parameter values are unavailable.
