Belgium). The dispute had arisen after a Belgian investigating judge issued an international arrest warrant - based on charges of war crimes in an internal armed conflict and crimes against humanity - against the incumbent Minister for foreign affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Mr. Abdulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The arrest warrant was issued under the Belgian Law of 16 June 1993 (as amended by the Law of 10 February 1999) which establishes that Belgian courts shall have \u201cpure\u201d universal jurisdiction in respect of serious violations of international humanitarian law. The Court found that Belgium violated its legal obligations towards the DRC in that it failed to respect the immunity from criminal jurisdiction and the inviolability which the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of the DRC enjoyed under international law. The Court also found that Belgium must cancel the arrest warrant and so inform the authorities to whom it was circulated.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1017/s2071832200014899", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 8]], "date-time": "2019-03-08T05:40:18Z", "timestamp": 1552023618000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["The ICJ Judgement on the Belgium v.

According to Article 27 (2) of the ICC Statute, personal immunities cannot be invoked - as it is obvious to some extent since it is an international tribunal - before the ICC. In principle however, they could bar the execution of an arrest warrant issued by the Court because States parties could be requested to co-operate with Court and, in doing so, they could violate their legal obligations as to personal immunities. The issue is dealt with by article 98 (1) which establishes that a waiver of immunity is a necessary condition to the execution of arrests or transfers only in those cases where the requested State is internationally obligated toward a State that is not party to the Statute. To put it differently, among State parties to the ICC there is an implicit waiver of personal immunities in case a state is requested to arrest or transfer a serving State official to the Court (even if he's a serving head of State). Of course this holds true only as cooperation between State parties and the ICC is concerned and does not have any bearing on the status of customary international law.
