Because of the proposed role of cathepsin D in a variety of biological and pathological processes, the characteristics of inhibition by the potentially useful agent, pepstatin, were determined. 2. The \u03b2 and \u03b3 forms of human cathepsin D, separated by isoelectric focusing, have identical specific extinction coefficients and specific activity in the degradation of haemoglobin. 3. Cathepsin D showed tight binding of 1 mol of pepstatin per 43000 g of protein, indicating that titration with the inhibitor represents a useful method for determination of absolute concentrations of the enzyme. 4. The titration curves were used to determine apparent dissociation constants (KD) for the binding of pepstatin and pepstatin methyl ester at pH3.5; values of approx. 5 } 10(-10)M were obtained. 5. Pepstatinyl-[3H]glycine was synthesized and shown to have a KD similar to that of pepstatin. Gel-chromatographic experiments showed that the binding of pepstatin and its derivatives is strongly pH-dependent. 6. The effect of pH on the KD for pepstatinyl-glycine was determined by equilibrium dialysis. As the pH was raised from 5.0 to 6.4, KD rose from 5 } 10(-10)M to 2 } 10(-6)M. 7. The catalytic activity of cathepsin D declines essentially to zero on going from pH5.0 to pH7.0, and we suggest that the binding site for substrate and pepstatin is abolished by a conformational change in the enzyme molecule. 8. The data indicate that, in biological experiments near neutral pH, large molar excesses of pepstatin over cathepsin D will be required for efficient inhibition.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1042/bj1550117", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 8, 10]], "date-time": "2015-08-10T20:02:55Z", "timestamp": 1439236975000}, "page": "117-125", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/crossmark_policy", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 98, "title": ["Interaction of human cathepsin D with the inhibitor pepstatin"], "prefix": "10.1042", "volume": "155", "author": [{"given": "C G", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Tissue Physiology Department, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Wort's Causeway, Cambridge CB1 4RN, U.K."}]}, {"given": "A J", "family": "Barrett", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "Tissue Physiology Department, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Wort's Causeway, Cambridge CB1 4RN, U.K."}]}], "member": "288", "container-title": ["Biochemical Journal"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/155/1/117/566110/bj1550117.pdf", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "syndication"}, {"URL": "http://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/155/1/117/566110/bj1550117.pdf", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 26]], "date-time": "2019-10-26T16:33:30Z", "timestamp": 1572107610000}, "score": 48.027794, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1976, 4, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1976, 4, 1]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bj1550117", "ISSN": ["0264-6021"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0264-6021", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 29]], "date-time": "2019-11-29T19:10:03Z", "timestamp": 1575054603885}, "reference-count": 15, "publisher": "Wiley", "issue": "2", "license": [{"URL": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1", "start": {"date-parts": [[1981, 11, 16]], "date-time": "1981-11-16T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 374716800000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}, {"URL": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor", "start": {"date-parts": [[2001, 10, 23]], "date-time": "2001-10-23T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1003795200000}, "delay-in-days": 7281, "content-version": "vor"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1981, 11, 16]]}, "DOI": "10.1016/0014-5793(81)80613-8", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 25]], "date-time": "2002-07-25T08:00:33Z", "timestamp": 1027584033000}, "page": "253-256", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["The localization of cathepsin D with a Biotin-labelled pepstatin"], "prefix": "10.1002", "volume": "134", "author": [{"given": "Ian T.W.", "family": "Matthews", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robert S.", "family": "Decker", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "C.Graham", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "311", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2001, 10, 23]]}, "reference": [{"key": "10.1016/0014-5793(81)80613-8-BIB20014579381806138-bib-BIB1|feb20014579381806138-cit-BIB1", "author": "Dingle", "volume": "88", "first-page": "821", "year": "1978", "journal-title": "Ann.

The impetus for this is fourfold. First, some argue that consumer behaviour has become more sophisticated and that people expect products to give them a number of life-style benefits. The benefits that products can give people include functional benefits (the product does something) and suprafunctional benefits (the product expresses something). Engagability is thus important in understanding people\u2019s preferences and relationships with products. Second, technological advances offer the possibility of designing experiences that are like those in the real world. Engagability is therefore important in providing an evaluative and exploratory approach to understanding \u201creal\u201d and \u201cvirtual\u201d experiences. Third, the experiences that people value (e.g., sports) require voluntary engagement. Thus, engagability is important in designing experiences that require discretionary use. Lastly, the product life cycle suggests the need to look beyond design to engagement. Products change from their initial production, through distribution to consumption. Each phase of this life cycle contains decision-making activities (e.g., purchasing, design, etc.). Engagability is an important research focus in explaining stakeholders\u2019 values in making these decisions. As such, engagability research seeks to understand the nature of experience in the real and virtual worlds. The activities that people become engaged with are often complex and social and thus challenge the traditional HCI focus on the single task directed user. Important application areas for this inquiry are learning, health and sport, and games. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.4018/978-1-59140-562-7.ch031", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 5, 24]], "date-time": "2011-05-24T16:34:27Z", "timestamp": 1306254867000}, "page": "196-198", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Engagability"], "prefix": "10.4018", "author": [{"given": "John", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "University of Central England, UK"}]}], "member": "2432", "container-title": ["Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=13122", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 2, 18]], "date-time": "2019-02-18T21:50:13Z", "timestamp": 1550526613000}, "score": 22.44743, "subtitle": [""], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2006]]}, "ISBN": ["9781591405627", "9781591407980"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59140-562-7.ch031"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T13:00:05Z", "timestamp": 1574514005243}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "IGI Global", "isbn-type": [{"value": "9781591405627", "type": "print"}, {"value": "9781591407980", "type": "electronic"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2006]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of HCI research and design has been to deliver universal usability. Universal usability is making interfaces to technology that everyone can access and use. However, this goal has been challenged in recent times. Critics of usability (e.g., Eliot, 2002) have argued that usability \u201cdumbs down\u201d the user-experience to the lowest common denominator. The critics propose that focusing on ease of use can ignore the sophistication of expert users and consumers. At the same time, researchers have begun to investigate suprafunctional qualities of design including pleasure (Jordan, 2000), emotion (Norman, 2003), and fun. While recent discussions in HCI have bought these questions to the surfaces, they relate to deeper philosophical issues about the moral implications of design. Molotch (2003, p. 7), states that: Decisions about what precisely to make and acquire, and when, where, and how to do it involve moral judgements about what a man is, what a woman is, how a man ought to treat his aged parents\u2026how he himself should grow old, gracefully or disgracefully, and so on. One response to this moral dilemma is to promote well-being rather than hedonism as an ethical design goal. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.4018/978-1-59140-562-7.ch032", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 5, 24]], "date-time": "2011-05-24T16:34:27Z", "timestamp": 1306254867000}, "page": "199-204", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Ethics and HCI"], "prefix": "10.4018", "author": [{"given": "John", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "University of Central England, UK"}]}], "member": "2432", "container-title": ["Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=13123", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 2, 18]], "date-time": "2019-02-18T21:50:13Z", "timestamp": 1550526613000}, "score": 22.44743, "subtitle": [""], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2006]]}, "ISBN": ["9781591405627", "9781591407980"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59140-562-7.ch032"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T21:49:12Z", "timestamp": 1574718552487}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Portland Press Ltd.", "issue": "3", "content-domain": {"domain": ["portlandpress.com"], "crossmark-restriction": true}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1980, 9, 1]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p>1.

Values of kcat. were maximal in the pH range 5.4\u20136.2, and depended on a single ionizing group of pKa 4.4. 5. Leupeptin was a purely competitive inhibitor of human cathepsin B. 6. The effect of pH on the apparent inhibitor constant, Ki (app.), was determined. Ki (app.) was pH-independent in the range pH 4.3\u20136.0, with the mean value 7 \u00d7 10(-9) M.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1042/bj1890447", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 8, 10]], "date-time": "2015-08-10T20:22:52Z", "timestamp": 1439238172000}, "page": "447-453", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/crossmark_policy", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 55, "title": ["Human cathepsin B.

They appear to be a response to the multi-disciplinary nature of the field and have a number of things in common. They are usually developed in response to a perceived lack of common understanding or shared reference. Frameworks often advocate a set of principles, a particular ethos, or expound a philosophical position, within which a collection of methods, approaches, tools, or patterns are framed. They aim to support design analysis, decision-making and guide activity, and provide a common vocabulary for multi-disciplinary teams. In contrast to some design methods and models, they tend to be broad and encompass a wider area of application. Rather than prescribe a single \u201ccorrect\u201d way of doing something, they provide a guiding structure that can be used flexibly to support a range of activity.

It proposes that to design usable, accessible, engaging and beneficial web sites, effort needs to focus on visceral, behavioural, reflective and social factors, while considering contexts such as the \u2018who and why\u2019, \u2018what and how\u2019, \u2018when and where\u2019 and \u2018with what\u2019 of web site use. Research methods from a variety of disciplines are used to support exploration, communication, empathy and speculation. Examples of the application of the EDF, to various stages of the web design process, are described.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.4018/978-1-59904-246-6.ch006", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 5, 24]], "date-time": "2011-05-24T16:24:45Z", "timestamp": 1306254285000}, "page": "130-147", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Design Methods for Experience Design"], "prefix": "10.4018", "author": [{"given": "Marie", "family": "Jefsioutine", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "University of Central England-Birmingham, UK"}]}, {"given": "John", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": [{"name": "University of Central England-Birmingham, UK"}]}], "member": "2432", "container-title": ["Human Computer Interaction Research in Web Design and Evaluation"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=22226", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 15]], "date-time": "2019-01-15T15:21:40Z", "timestamp": 1547565700000}, "score": 19.475964, "subtitle": [""], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2007]]}, "ISBN": ["9781599042466", "9781599042480"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59904-246-6.ch006"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T01:54:32Z", "timestamp": 1575424472687}, "reference-count": 10, "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn-type": [{"value": "9781538685556", "type": "electronic"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3]]}, "DOI": "10.1109/hri.2019.8673303", "type": "proceedings-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 25]], "date-time": "2019-03-25T22:51:27Z", "timestamp": 1553554287000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Persuasive ChairBots: A Robot Recruited Experiment"], "prefix": "10.1109", "author": [{"given": "Abhijeet", "family": "Agnihotri", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Heather", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "263", "event": {"name": "2019 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)", "location": "Daegu, Korea (South)", "start": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 11]]}, "end": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 14]]}}, "container-title": ["2019 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)"], "link": [{"URL": "http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8666012/8673065/08673303.pdf?arnumber=8673303", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 28]], "date-time": "2019-03-28T06:53:59Z", "timestamp": 1553756039000}, "score": 19.475964, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3]]}, "ISBN": ["9781538685556"], "references-count": 10, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hri.2019.8673303"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2019-11-21T10:58:24Z", "timestamp": 1574333904575}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Wiley", "issue": "4", "license": [{"URL": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1", "start": {"date-parts": [[2015, 9, 1]], "date-time": "2015-09-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1441065600000}, "delay-in-days": 2125, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12]]}, "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01589_36.x", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 11, 6]], "date-time": "2009-11-06T11:18:22Z", "timestamp": 1257506302000}, "page": "896-897", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Roots of human sociality: culture, cognition and interaction - Edited by N.J.

However, the role of this enzyme in connective tissue matrix degradation is uncertain because there are no histochemical methods for determining whether or not the cathepsin D is active at such sites in living tissues. We considered that the combined use of a labelled tight-binding inhibitor with immunoprecipitation of the enzymes might overcome this problem. We have explored the application of derivatives of the inhibitor pepstatin, as only active cathepsin D binds pepstatin tightly. A series of N-pepstatinyl-N'-dinitrophenyl-alpha, omega-diaminoalkanes were synthesized with alkyl-chain lengths of two, four and six carbon atoms. These compounds were tight-binding inhibitors of human cathepsin D. In fluorescence-quenching titrations the dinitrophenyl groups were also fully available to bind high-affinity anti-dinitrophenyl antibody. It was shown by immunodiffusion in gels and by gel permeation chromatography that N-pepstatinyl-N'-dinitrophenyl-1,6-diaminohexane was a bifunction inhibitor able to bind cathepsin D and anti-dinitrophenyl antibody at the same time.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1042/bj1910835", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 8, 10]], "date-time": "2015-08-10T20:24:57Z", "timestamp": 1439238297000}, "page": "835-843", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/crossmark_policy", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["Interaction of dinitrophenyl-pepstatins with human cathepsin D and with anti-dinitrophenyl antibody.
