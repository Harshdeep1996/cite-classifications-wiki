Age and BMI matched 24 apparently healthy females were also selected Control. To assess the large airway ventilatory function, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/ FVC% and PEFR of all subjects were measured with a portable digital Spirometer, PONY FX (Cosmed, Italy) at Day 0. In addition, all these variables were again measured in the RA patients after 180 days of MTX therapy. For statistical analysis, independent sample t test and paired sample t test were performed.Results: All the study variables (except FEV1/FVC%) were significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower in RA groups at day 0 as well as at day 180, compared to healthy controls.

Methods: Serum Total Cholesterol, Triglyceride, HDL-Cholesterol and LDL-Cholesterol levels were estimated and blood pressure was measured in apparently healthy adult shift worker and non shift worker participants. Total 60 subjects age ranged from 20-50 years were selected, of whom 30 were shift workers (Study) for at least one year and 30 were non shift workers (control). Height, weight and resting blood pressure of all the subjects were recorded before collection of blood. Blood samples were collected after over night fasting for estimation of serum lipid and lipoprotein levels and were measured by standard laboratory technique. Data were analyzed by unpaired \u2018t' test. Results: The mean serum Total Cholesterol and LDL-Cholesterol levels were significantly higher in shift workers compared to those of non shift workers. Again mean serum Triglyceride and HDL-Cholesterol levels in the shift workers did not differ significantly from that of non shift workers. These changes may be related to internal desynchronization due to disruption of circadian rhythm. Conclusion: The changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels with the exception of HDL-Cholesterol and Triglyceride in the subjects engaged in shift work may put them at increased risk for coronary artery disease.

The mean of measured values of PaCO2 and HCO3-were analyzed statistically in relation to 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimesters of pregnant women &amp; non-pregnant women. The PaCO2 and HCO3- were significantly lower in 1st trimester, 2nd trimester &amp; 3rd trimester of pregnant women than that of non-pregnant women. There were no statistically significant difference of PaCO2 and HCO3- between the 1st trimester and 2nd trimester; between the 1st trimester and 3rd trimester; and between the 2nd trimester and 3rd trimester of pregnant women. It may be concluded that the causes of progressively decreased PaCO2 and HCO3- throughout the pregnancy were most likely to be due to effect of progesterone causing hyperventilation. Hyperventilation in pregnancy is due to hypersensitivity of respiratory centre. Due to hyperventilation, there is expelling out CO2 and HCO3- causing decreases PaCO2 and HCO3- during pregnancy. doi: 10.3329/jbsp.v3i0.1788 J Bangladesh Soc Physiol.2008 Dec;(3):13-16.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/jbsp.v3i0.1788", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 1, 6]], "date-time": "2009-01-06T11:58:24Z", "timestamp": 1231243104000}, "page": "13-16", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Progressive Decline of Partial Pressure of Carbon dioxide and Bicarbonate levels in Arterial Blood of Pregnant Women"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Dipok Kumar", "family": "Sunyal", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Md Ruhul", "family": "Amin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MH", "family": "Molla", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "MA Momen", "family": "Talukder", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Abida", "family": "Ahmed", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Momotaj", "family": "Begum", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Journal of Bangladesh Society of Physiologist"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JBSP/article/download/1788/1699", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JBSP/article/download/1788/1699", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 7]], "date-time": "2019-01-07T11:42:03Z", "timestamp": 1546861323000}, "score": 25.29253, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jbsp.v3i0.1788", "ISSN": ["1995-1213"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1995-1213", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T05:43:36Z", "timestamp": 1574487816634}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Bangladesh Journals Online (JOL)", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["J Bangladesh Soc Physiol"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Association of increased cardiovascular morbidity and higher sympathetic activity in\u00a0 patients with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been recognized.

Study design &amp; Methodology: A prospective case control animal study with 85 female and 30 male rats (Total 115 rats) was done in the Department of Pharmacology of Dhaka Medical College and Bangladesh Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh from July 2002 to December 2003. The total 85 female rats were grouped into case study or exposure group (N=60 female rats) exposed to water extract of AP &amp; control or non exposure group (N=25 female rats, 30 male rats also considered as control group) Exposure group (water extract) of female were again subdivided in 3 groups according to duration of (A.P) exposure (N=20 in each group) e.g. 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks. Mating schedules were done after the completion of scheduled duration of exposure with A.P (Dose was 1 gm/kg).  Results: In group I percentage of infertility was 33.33% in 4 weeks exposure, 50% in 6 weeks exposure &amp; 100% in 8 weeks exposure respectively. In control group (Group II) percentage of infertility was 0%. In case study group of female rats the value of FSH was 1.20 1U/L (4 weeks), 1.12 1U/L (6 weeks), 1.00 1U/L (8 weeks), LH 0.78 1U/L (4 weeks), 0.70 1U/L (6 weeks), 0.64 1U/L (8 weeks), Estrogen 45.30 pg/ml (4 weeks), 44.80 pg/ml (6 weeks), 44.20 pg/ml (8 weeks) and Progesterone 4.84 nmol/L (4 weeks), 4.72 nmol/L (6 weeks) and 3.80 nmol/L (8 weeks). In non exposure group the value of FSH was 1.23 1U/L, LH 0.80 1U/L, Estrogen 47.05 pg/L and Progesterone 5.50 nmol/L. In exposure group all the values were lesser than the normal hormonal value.  Conclusion: This study suggests that due to lower level of hormone, female rats have promising percentage of infertility with AP. Further study is needed with rat as well as clinical trial with human being.

Methods: This crosssectional study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, BSMMU, Dhaka, from 1st July 2008 to 30th June 2009 on 60 hypothyroid female patients of 30-50 years age (Group B). For comparison, 30 age and BMI matched apparently healthy subjects (Group A) were also studied. Based on receiving treatment, hypothyroid patients were divided into B1 (untreated patients on their 1st day of diagnosis) and B2 (patients treated for at least 12-18 months). They were selected from the Out Patient Department of Endocrinology wing of department of Medicine, BSMMU, Dhaka. Serum TSH and FT4 levels were measured by Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) principle in AxSYM system. The FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC%, of all the subjects were measured by a digital MicroDL spirometer. Data were analyzed by One way ANOVA test, Independent sample t- test and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient test. Results: The mean percentage of predicted values of all the lung function variables in healthy female subjects and treated hypothyroids were within normal ranges. However, all of them were lower in untreated hypothyroids in comparison to those of control and treated hypothyroids.FVC and FEV1 showed statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) difference and FEV1/FVC% showed non significant difference . In addition, all the ventilatory variables had negative correlation with serum TSH level and positive correlation with serum FT4 level and these relationships were statistically significant in control (p&lt;0.001) and treated hypothyroids (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: This study reveals that lung function may be lower in untreated hypothyrod patients and correlated with thyroid hormones. Treatment of hypothyroids may reverse this changes.

In this paper we described a case of a successful pregnancy in a young woman with advanced cirrhosis facing life threatening condition in her last trimester and perioperative period.Bangladesh J Obstet Gynaecol, 2013; Vol. 28(2) : 100-102</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/bjog.v28i2.30098", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 23]], "date-time": "2016-10-23T11:13:09Z", "timestamp": 1477221189000}, "page": "100-102", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Massive intra-abdominal Haemorrhage in a Pregnant Patient with Cirrhosis of Liver - A Case Report"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "28", "author": [{"given": "Monowara", "family": "Begum", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Housneara", "family": "Begum", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 23]]}, "container-title": ["Bangladesh Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJOG/article/download/30098/20200", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJOG/article/download/30098/20200", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 31]], "date-time": "2018-12-31T19:52:34Z", "timestamp": 1546285954000}, "score": 24.489937, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 23]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 23]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjog.v28i2.30098", "ISSN": ["2408-8404", "1018-4287"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1018-4287", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2408-8404", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T20:12:08Z", "timestamp": 1575403928300}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Bangladesh Journals Online (JOL)", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Bangladesh J Med Microbiol"], "abstract": "<jats:p>No AbstractDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjmm.v5i2.16935 Bangladesh J Med Microbiol 2011; 05 (02): 27-29</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3329/bjmm.v5i2.16935", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 24]], "date-time": "2013-11-24T15:45:32Z", "timestamp": 1385307932000}, "page": "27-29", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Role of Molecular Biology as Diagnostic tools of Infectious disease- an update"], "prefix": "10.3329", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "Afroza", "family": "Begum", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Shahanara", "family": "Begum", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1861", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 10]]}, "container-title": ["Bangladesh Journal of Medical Microbiology"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJMM/article/download/16935/12018", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJMM/article/download/16935/12018", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 30]], "date-time": "2018-12-30T20:31:27Z", "timestamp": 1546201887000}, "score": 24.489937, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 24]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjmm.v5i2.16935", "ISSN": ["2072-3105", "2070-1810"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2070-1810", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2072-3105", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T21:27:59Z", "timestamp": 1575494879293}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Bangladesh Journals Online (JOL)", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2014, 6, 23]], "date-time": "2014-06-23T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1403481600000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Bangladesh J.

With advanced obstetric care, this fistula\u00a0 is rare in industrialized world but it is still a major health\u00a0 problem in underdeveloped countries, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa and Asia including Bangladesh. Victim of fistula become physically cripple, socially outcast,\u00a0 psychologically traumatized. Surgical repair is the definitive\u00a0 cure. A surgeon with adequate training and experience can optimize outcome of surgery by modifying techniques.\u00a0 Repair of vesicovaginal fistula remains a major challenge\u00a0 to surgeon worldwide. Aim of the study was to undertake a baseline evaluation of all genitourinary fistula cases and to share the experience\u00a0 of management of fistula with others.\u00a0 This descriptive study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sylhet M.A.G. Osmani MedicalCollege Hospital. A total 311 genitourinary fistula cases were admitted and managed here from July 2004 to March\u00a0 2010. In this study 64.63% of the patients were between 20-35yrs of age (range 18-70yrs), 42.76% were primipara whereas 20.57% were grandmulti. Height was &lt;145cm in 67.84% cases. Majority (80.38%) of the patients were from poor socioeconomic status; 91.63% was housewife, and 89.38% was illiterate. Obstructed labour was responsible for 86.81% of fistula.\u00a0 Vesico-vaginal fistula was the most common (87.46%) type of fistula and 79.43% of fistula was complex in nature. 92.10% had local repair through vaginal approach, labial \u00a0fat graft was used in 44% cases. \u00a0In this study out of 242 operation 85.54 %(n-207) had successful repair. Among them 75.61% patient were completely continent.\u00a0 Causes of failure were likely to be due to extensive scarring with loss of tissue, previous failed repair, large size of fistula\u00a0 and in some cases post-operative catheter problem and\u00a0 infection. Fistula is largely a preventable condition. More emphasis\u00a0 should be given on prevention of fistula by increasing\u00a0 community awareness, female education and empowerment, avoiding early marriage, family planning, improved\u00a0 maternity services, timely referral and availability of emergency obstetric care services.
