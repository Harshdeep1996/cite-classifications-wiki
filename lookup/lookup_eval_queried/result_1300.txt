The first case of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) was observed in a 57-year-old woman with natural killer (NK)\u2013LGL leukemia and transfusion-dependent anemia. Using a genetic approach, we demonstrated that killing of pulmonary endothelial cells by patient NK cells was mediated by dysregulated balance in activating and inhibitory NK-receptor signaling. Elevated pulmonary artery pressure and erythroid differentiation improved after disrupting the NK-receptor signaling pathway with 4 courses of a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, tipifarnib. Coincidental association between PAH and LGL leukemia suggest a causal relationship between the expanded lymphocyte population and these clinical manifestations.

(LGL) leukemia is associated with increased numbers of circulating NK or T-LGL cells with only 5% of these cases related to NK-cell expansion. NK-LGL leukemia is primarily characterized by chronic anemia in association with low to normal numbers of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and chronic neutropenia. Here, we explore the mechanism of pathogenesis in the first case report of a patient with NK-LGL leukemia in association with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). This patient displayed a diffuse pulmonary infiltrate with sustained elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure at rest confirmed by right-sided cardiac catheterization meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria for PPH. Association between T-LGL leukemia and PPH has been reported previously suggesting a causitive link between LGL expansion and PPH pathogenesis.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>METHODS: Cytotoxicity of a normal pulmonary endothelial cell line (CRL-2598) was determined by 5-hr 51-Cr-release assays using NK-cells from this NK-LGL patient compared to healthy controls. Specific NK receptors were blocked by antibodies added to the effector cells for 30 min prior to the cytotoxicity assay. Production of TNF\u03b1 was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining with detection by flow cytometry. To block NK receptor signals, dominant negative adaptor proteins, DAP10 and DAP12, were constructed and expressed in recombinant vaccinia viruses. These viruses were engineered to carry a single Y-A mutation at Y102 or a double mutation at both Y9 and Y102 within the YxxM activating ITAM motif of the adaptor protein. Perforin granule mobilization was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS: Sixty-eight % of peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from this patient were phenotypically NK-LGLs with skewed reactivity to the anti-CD158a antibody (KIR2DS1/2DS2), which was shown by mRNA analysis to consist primarily of activating KIR2DS1. We examined the susceptibility of CRL-2598 cells to NK lysis and found that patient-derived NK-cells produced greater lysis without prior activation than healthy controls. Furthermore, NK-cells from this patient produced more TNF-\u03b1 in response to paraformaldehyde-fixed CRL-2598 cells and displayed perforin granule mobilization to the contact site between effector and target cells. Addition of blocking antibodies against the activating receptors NKG2D and KIR2DS1/KIR2DL1 (anti-CD158a) produced a blockade in this process showing that these receptors were responsible for lysis. When DAP10 and DAP12 adaptor signaling steps were blocked, killing and perforin granule redistribution toward the contact site of the conjugated targets was suppressed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSION: This study shows that the presence of activating NK-receptors and DAP10/DAP12 adaptors contibuted to lysis of normal endothelial cells in this patient. DAP10 and DAP12 are key initiators for both NK\u2212 and T\u2212cell function suggesting that targeted disruption of these signaling events may prove beneficial for autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as PPH and LGL leukemia.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v110.11.4704.4704", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 11]], "date-time": "2019-10-11T00:05:02Z", "timestamp": 1570752302000}, "page": "4704-4704", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Aberrant NK Receptor Signaling Associated with Large Granular Lymphoycte Leukemia and Primary Pulmonary Hypertension."], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "110", "author": [{"given": "P.K.", "family": "Epling-Burnette", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

expansion in patients with T-large-granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia occurs by an undefined mechanism that may be related to Fas apoptosis resistance. Here, we demonstrate polarized expansion of CD8+ terminal-memory differentiation in such patients, as demonstrated by CD45RA expression and absence of CD62L expression, suggesting repeated stimulation by antigen in vivo. Elimination of antigen-stimulated T cells normally occurs through Fas-mediated apoptosis. We show that cells from LGL leukemia patients express increased levels of c-FLIP and display resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis and abridged recruitment of proteins that comprise the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), including the Fas-associated protein with death-domain (FADD) and caspase-8. Exposure to interleukin-2 (IL-2) for only 24 hours sensitized leukemic LGL to Fas-mediated apoptosis with enhanced formation of the DISC, and increased caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities. We observed dysregulation of c-FLIP by IL-2 in leukemic LGL, suggesting a role in Fas resistance. Our results demonstrate that expanded T cells in patients with LGL leukemia display both functional and phenotypic characteristics of prior antigen activation in vivo and display reduced capacity for Fas-mediated DISC formation.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2007-06-093823", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2007, 11, 10]], "date-time": "2007-11-10T01:35:02Z", "timestamp": 1194658502000}, "page": "1610-1616", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 50, "title": ["Antigen activation and impaired Fas-induced death-inducing signaling complex formation in T-large-granular lymphocyte leukemia"], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "111", "author": [{"given": "Jun", "family": "Yang", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Penn State Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA; and"}]}, {"given": "P.

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>T-cell receptor signaling along with intermittent homeostatic proliferation governed by STAT3/5-associated common \u03b3 chain (\u03b3c) cytokines IL-6, IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 are the principal source of new T-cells after thymic involution. Persistent chronic infections and cancer lead to T-cell exhaustion characterized by a number of \u201cexhaustion\u201d-associated phenotypic changes and activation of a specific gene expression profile associated with negative regulation of cytokine signaling response over time. Lymphoproliferation, as seen in large granular lymphocyte leukemia, results from excessive proliferation in response to one or more of these cytokines leading to in vivo expansion. We showed previously using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) that most LGL leukemia patients display constitutively active STAT3 DNA binding activity. Recently, an international group discovered that 30-40 % of patients have somatic mutations in STAT3. This provides new molecular insight into the basis of LGL leukemia, but does not resolve some key questions about the biology. First, leukemic LGL cells are not fully immortalized by the activation or mutation of STAT3 suggesting that their survival and expansion may be microenvironmentally regulated. Second, it is unclear if the STAT3 mutation is acquired within the clonal cell population that invariably possesses an \u201cexhaustion-associated\u201d CD57+/CD8+/CD28-/CD62L-/CD27- memory phenotype. Here, we determined the role of cytokine signaling in LGL leukemia.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To gain insight into the disease, we examined primary human T-cells from healthy controls (N=28) and LGL leukemia patients (N=28). In the LGL leukemia cohort, 14 patients harbored one of the recurring STAT3 mutations within the SH2 domain (Y640F, D661Y, D661H, D661V). The remaining LGL leukemia patients had no evidence of genomic abnormalities. Using these primary cells, we examined proliferation potential and pSTAT3/5 activation by flow cytometry (phosFlow) using methods published previously by our group. Signaling was determined after culture with 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/ml of IL-6 to activate STAT3, and similar doses of IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 to activate STAT5.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>First, LGL leukemia cells showed hyperproliferative responses to the lowest dose of IL-15. Comparing CD57+ and CD57- T-cells in healthy individuals, CD57+ T-cells were hyporesponsive to all cytokines with regard to proliferation and phosphorylation in line with their exhausted phenotype. Next, we examined cytokine-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 in LGL cases. STAT3 was normally phosphorylated in response to IL-6 in LGL leukemia T-cells. In contrast, hypersensitive STAT5 phosphorylation in response to the lowest dose of IL-6 (p=0.05), IL-2 (p=0.04), IL-7 (p=0.01), and IL-15 (p=0.02) occurred within CD57- T-cells. This occurred equally in both STAT3 mutant and non-mutant patient groups. The traditional CD57+ leukemic T-cell population was also hypersensitive to 100 fold-lower doses of IL-7 and IL-15 compared to healthy donors and again this difference was independent of the STAT3 mutation status.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>LGL leukemia T-cells bypass protective mechanisms associated with T-cell exhaustion and display proliferation potential and hypersensitivity to STAT3/5-associated common \u03b3 chain (\u03b3c) cytokines. Similar differences in signaling were observed in both STAT3 mutant and non-mutant cases suggesting that it is a unifying abnormality. Although STAT3 was not hyperphosphorylated, it is possible that STAT3 is activated by enhanced dimerization capacity (STAT3-SH2 domain mutation) or through lack of negative regulators such as a deficiency in SOCS proteins. Our data, however, introduces a novel concept in this disease and suggests that the driving event lies within the CD57- population, where hypersensensitive STAT5 phosphorylation was evident in response to all cytokines. These results suggest that the driver mutation or event possibly resides within the common lymphoid progenitor population and that the presence of clonally-expanded CD57+ cells may result from incomplete exhaustion reprogramming following excessive cytokine-mediated proliferation within the lymphoid population.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v122.21.1628.1628", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 12]], "date-time": "2019-10-12T03:56:54Z", "timestamp": 1570852614000}, "page": "1628-1628", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Common \u03b3 Chain (\u03b3c) Cytokine Hypersensitivity Leads To T-Cell Homeostatic Deregulation Independent Of STAT3 Mutation In Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia"], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "122", "author": [{"given": "Adam W", "family": "Mailloux", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Immunology Program, H.

The etiology of LGL leukemia is currently unknown, however, T cell activation, loss of lymph node homing receptor L-selectin (CD62L), and increased accumulation of T cells in the bone marrow may lead to suppressed blood cell production. The broad resistance to Fas (CD95) apoptotic signals has lead to the hypothesis that amplification of clonal cells occurs through apoptosis resistance. However, the proliferative history has not been carefully studied. To define possible mechanism of LGL leukemia expansion, T cell phenotype, proliferative history, and functional-related surface marker expression were analyzed.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 16 LGL leukemia patients that met diagnostic criteria based on the presence of clonal a\u03b2 T cells and &gt;300 cells/ml CD3+/CD57+ T cells in the peripheral blood. Samples were obtained from 10 age-matched healthy individuals from the Southwest Florida Blood Services for comparisons. Multi-analyte flow cytometry was conducted for expression of CD3, CD4/8, CD45RA, CD62L, CD27, CD28, CD25, CD127, IL15Ra, IL21a, CCR7 (all antibodies from BD Biosciences). The proliferative index was determined by Ki67 expression in fixed and permeabilized cells (BD Biosciences) and the proliferative history in vivo was assessed by T-cell-receptor excision circle (TREC) measurement using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. TRECs are episomal fragments generated during TCR gene rearrangements that fail to transfer to daughter cells and thus diminish with each population doubling that reflects the in vivo proliferative history.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Compared to healthy controls, significantly fewer CD8+ nai\u0308ve cells (CD45RA+/CD62L+, 8.4 \u00b1 10.8 vs 24.48 \u00b1 11.99, p=0.003) and higher CD8+ terminal effector memory (TEM) T cells (CD45RA+/CD62L-, 67.74 \u00b1 28.75 vs 39.33 \u00b1 11.32, p=0.007) were observed in the peripheral blood. In contrast, the percentage of CD4+ nai\u0308ve and memory cells (nai\u0308ve, central memory, effector memory, and terminal effector memory based on CD45RA and CD62L expression) was similar in patients as compared to controls. The expression of CD27 (31.32 \u00b1 34.64 vs 71.73 \u00b1 20.63, p=0.003) and CD28 (31.38 \u00b1 31.91 vs 70.02 \u00b1 22.93, p=0.002) were lower in CD8+ T cell from patients with LGL leukemia and this reduction predominated within the TEM population (17.63\u00b124.5 vs 70.98\u00b122.5 for CD27, p&lt;0.0001 and 13\u00b120.5 vs 69.43\u00b1 21.59 for CD28, p&lt;0.0001). Loss of these markers is consistent with prior antigen activation. There was no difference in CD25 (IL2Ra, p=0.2) expression on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, but CD127 (IL7Ra, p=0.001), IL15Ra, and IL21Ra (p=0.15) were overexpressed in TEM CD8+ T cell in patients vs controls. All of these cytokine receptors belong to the IL2R\u03b2g-common cytokine receptor superfamily that mediates homeostatic proliferation. In CD8+ T cells in patients, the IL-21Ra was also overexpressed in nai\u0308ve, central and effector memory T cells. The topography of the expanded CD8+ T cell population was therefore consistent with overexpression of activation markers and proliferation-associated cytokine receptors. Therefore, we next analyzed Ki67 expression and TREC DNA copy number to quantify actively dividing cells and determine the proliferative history, respectively. We found that LGL leukemia patients have more actively dividing CD8+ TEM T cells compared to controls (3.2 \u00b1 3.12 in patients vs 0.44 \u00b1 0.44 in controls, p=0.001). Moreover, the TREC copy number in CD8+ T cells was statistically higher in healthy individuals after adjusting for age (177.54 \u00b1 232 in patients vs 1015 \u00b1 951 in controls, p=0.019). These results show that CD8+ cells in the peripheral compartment have undergone more population doublings in vivo compared to healthy donors. In contrast, the TREC copies in CD4+ T-cells were similar between LGL patients and controls (534.4 \u00b1 644 in patients vs 348.78 \u00b1 248.16 in controls, p&gt;0.05) demonstrating selective cellular proliferation within the CD8 compartment.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>CD8+ T- cells are undergoing robust cellular activation, contraction in repertoire diversity, and enhanced endogenous proliferation in patients with LGL leukemia.

We have examined the repertoire of NK receptors expressed on these cells and delineated the functional activity. We found skewed NK receptor expression on patient NK cells. Reactivity to a single anti-killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (anti-KIR) antibody was noted in 7 of 13 patients. LDGL patients variably expressed NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 RNA. In contrast, CD94 and its inhibitory heterodimerization partner NKG2A were homogenously expressed at high levels on these NK cells. Interestingly, these patients expressed a large number of activating KIR receptors by genotype analysis. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that lower than normal levels of RNA of the inhibitory KIR was present in some patients in contrast to normal NK cells. Consistent with a high level of activating receptors, we found the NK-LDGL cells have potent cytolytic function in both direct and redirected cytotoxicity assays. These results demonstrate that patients with NK-LDGL have an increased activating-to-inhibitory KIR ratio. This altered ratio might induce inappropriate lysis or cytokine production and impact the disease pathogenesis.

Chronic neutropenia, anemia, and arthritis are clinical manifestations mediated by autoimmune reactivity of this lymphocyte population. Previously, we found evidence that extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and Ras were constitutively active in the patient\u2019s LGLs. Ablation of Ras activity by a dominant-negative form of Ras and pharmacologic inhibition with farnesyltransferase inhibitors FTI2153 and R115777 (tipifarnib, Zarnestra\u00ae, Johnson &amp; Johnson) resulted in ERK inhibition and enhanced apoptosis of the leukemic LGLs. A multicenter phase 2 clinical trial using tipifarnib was initiated with a two-stage design. Here we provide the first report of the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib in patients with LGL leukemia.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>METHODS: Patients were to be treated in the first stage with four cycles of therapy at a dose of 300 mg twice daily for 21 days out of a 28- day intermittent cycle. Key patient entry criteria were neutrophil counts &lt; 500 cells/\u03bcl, transfusion-dependent anemia, and clonal CD3+/CD57+ T-cells greater than 350 cells/\u03bcl in the peripheral blood. WBC, ALC, hemoglobin, platelet counts, and ANC were determined. Bone marrow biopsies were performed on all patients prior to therapy and then repeated when worsening cytopenias occurred. Tipifarnib was stopped when bone marrow cellularity was reduced by 50% compared to baseline. Bone marrow colony formation assessed using14-day CFU-GM and BFU-E assays in methycellulose (Stem Cell Separation Systems, Vancouver BC). Growth factor support with G-CSF was allowed during the 7 days off when ANCs were &lt; 500 cells/\u03bcl.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS: Five males and two females (mean 57 years old) received tipifarnib. Four patients failed to complete the study due to toxicity. Three patients were removed from study due to grade 3\u20134 bone marrow toxicity and/or infections requiring hospitalization and a tipifarnib-unrelated death occurred in one patient. Three patients completed four cycles and were evaluated for response with a dose reduction for bone marrow toxicity required in one of these evaluable patients. Leukemic LGL cells from the three evaluable patients displayed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in vitro and treatment was associated with reduced ALCs in two cases. None of the patients met the pre-determined criteria for response. However, one patient, shown to be growth factor unresponsive prior to therapy, had an increase in ANC from 0 at baseline to 8,600 cells/\u03bcl while receiving G-CSF on week 16. The number of bone marrow colonies also increased in this patient after therapy. All bone marrow biopsies, which were required in five cases, showed significantly improved erythroid or myeloid differentiation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in bone marrow differentiation suggest that tipifarnib may prove beneficial for the treatment of LGL leukemia if a safe dose and schedule is established and the treatment prolonged to allow for bone marrow recovery.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v110.11.3132.3132", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 13]], "date-time": "2019-10-13T15:50:13Z", "timestamp": 1570981813000}, "page": "3132-3132", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["First Clinical Report of Tipifarnib for the Treatment of T-Large Granular Lymphocyte (LGL) Leukemia."], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "110", "author": [{"given": "P.K.", "family": "Epling-Burnette", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

Although all of these drugs directly inhibit bcr-abl, off target effects are potentially responsible for their side effects. Of these TKIs, dasatinib is effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. It has been shown that some dasatinib treated patients' exhibit adverse side effects resulting in colitis, pleural effusions and fevers. In conjunction with these adverse side effects, patients have been shown to present with oligoclonal expansions of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). We have now further characterized this phenomenon in fifty-six patients treated with five different TKIs. Age matched healthy controls as well as untreated newly diagnosed CML patients were used for comparisons. TCR clonality was determined using total cellular DNA subjected to amplification with a series of oligonucleotide primers for regions of the T-cell receptor genes and a flow cytometry based V-beta repertoire panel. Levels of activated nuclear T-bet and NF\u03baB were analyzed by utilizing the respective Active Motif's Trans-AM T-bet and NF\u03baB family kit in conjunction with the nuclear extraction kit according to established protocol. An analysis of membrane-bound IL-15 in LGL cells was determined by flow cytometry with commercially available mouse anti-human IL-15 in conjunction with CD3, CD8, CD16, CD56 and CD57. PDGF BB plasma levels were determined with ELISA techniques using plates generated from commercially available antibodies. Regulatory T cell percentages were investigated also by flow cytometry using mouse anti-human CD4, CD25 and CD127. Patients on dasatinib therapy with and without side effects show an elevated membrane bound IL-15, as well as modest elevated PDGF-BB plasma levels, both of which have been shown to be important in LGL survival. Patients with LGL expansions had constitutively active NF\u03baB and variable T-bet expression in the CD8+ compartment in the setting of alpha/beta TCR clonality. Imatinib treated patients without significant side effects show broader plasma levels of PDGF-BB as well as an elevated membrane bound IL-15 expression with variable T-bet and NF\u03baB expression. All patients treated with nilotinib showed low expression of IL-15, T-bet and NF\u03baB expression as well as low levels of PDGF-BB. TCR clonality with or without LGL expansions is a relatively common phenomenon in CML patients under therapy with TKI's. In patients treated with dasatinib, some adverse side effects typically related with this drug are more frequently associated with this event. However, the ultimate mechanism of these clonal expansions is still unclear. A decreased percentage of regulatory T-cells or enhancement of antigen presentation capability that overcomes tolerance mechanisms has been described by our group and could play an important role. Finally, the inhibition of tyrosine kinases involved in the regulation of memory lymphocytes development is under investigation in our laboratory.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Pinilla: Novartis: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding, Speakers Bureau; Bristol-Myers Squibb: Research Funding; exelixis: Research Funding.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>", "DOI": "10.1182/blood.v114.22.2204.2204", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 12]], "date-time": "2019-10-12T08:34:32Z", "timestamp": 1570869272000}, "page": "2204-2204", "update-policy": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019cm0000", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Molecular and Functional Analysis of Large Granular Lymphocyte Expansions in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Patients Undergoing Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy."], "prefix": "10.1182", "volume": "114", "author": [{"given": "John J.", "family": "Powers", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": [{"name": "Immunology, H.
