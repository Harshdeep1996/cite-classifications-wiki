With this chronicle at his disposal, Barth was able, for the first time, to present a meaningful outline of the history of the Songhay empire. Circumstances prevented Barth bringing back a complete copy of the manuscript. In the 1890's, however, following the French occupation, three manuscripts of that chronicle reached Paris, to be edited by 0. Houdas and E. Benoist, translated by Houdas, and published in 1898\u20131900.

This condition was usually, if not almost universally, present and derived in part from the fact that the administrators of religious houses, especially the small ones, were not well trained for the complexities of their tasks. The official records of the royal chancery abound with notices that monasteries suffered from this malady, and the entries in these records follow a pattern, repeating time and time again a variety of standard charges. Having perhaps endured internal dissension that had contributed to the economic difficulty, monasteries became impoverished by indiscreet rule, their goods were wasted, and they experienced mismanagement. In addition, the documents assert that these troubled monasteries suffered from indebtedness, that lax discipline prevailed, and that lands of religious corporations were alienated illegally. Finally, the entries maintain that the ill-advised sale of corodies, and the unwarranted grants of pensions contributed to a depressed monastic economy. To illustrate these observations upon defective monastic administration, reference to specific examples is needed.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1017/s0362152900011594", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 8, 19]], "date-time": "2016-08-19T09:09:08Z", "timestamp": 1471597748000}, "page": "473-482", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Mismanagement and Ecclesiastical Visitation of English Monasteries in the Early-Fourteenth Century"], "prefix": "10.1017", "volume": "28", "author": [{"given": "Edwin N.", "family": "Gorsuch", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "56", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 7, 29]]}, "reference": [{"key": "S0362152900011594_fn19", "unstructured": "See Knowles , Religious Orders I 47 and 104, for comments on John of Rutherwyk, also Registrum Henrici Woodlock 533\u2013537 (an entry under the year 1314)."}, {"key": "S0362152900011594_fn17", "unstructured": "Victoria History (cit. n. 15) III 97\u201398.", "DOI": "10.1093/swra/15.2.97", "doi-asserted-by": "crossref"}, {"key": "S0362152900011594_fn16", "DOI": "10.2307/2848143", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "S0362152900011594_fn15", "unstructured": "Page William (ed.), The Victoria History of the County of York III (London 1913) 97\u201398."}, {"key": "S0362152900011594_fn14", "unstructured": "Thompson A.
