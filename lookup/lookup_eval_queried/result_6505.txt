The maximum likelihood method of cointegration developed by Johansen (1988) was used in the study. The dynamics of short-run price responses were examined using vector error correction model (VECM). The results indicated that five potato markets reacted on the long-run cointegrating equations while the speed of price adjustment in the short-run was almost absent. Moreover, it was found that the longer the distance between the markets, the weaker the integration was. To increase the efficiency of potato markets in Uttarakhand, there is need to focus on building an improved market information system. This system should be able to disseminate timely market information about price, demand and supply of produce to enable producers, traders and consumers to make proper production and marketing decisions.SAARC J.

The study is based on secondary data on wholesale monthly/weekly arrivals and prices for the period of 2000-01 to 2009-10. The seasonality in wholesale price was analyzed using multiplicative model; the Fourier analysis was used to analyze cyclical variation in wholesale prices and Autoregressive model to study the relationship between market arrival and price of vegetables in market of hill region of Nepal. It was found that during the post-harvest period, the wholesale price ruled very low while during the lean period, the prices were quite high which is due to seasonal and perishable nature of the vegetables. The entire vegetables registered the positive and increasing trend and periodicities of 2 to 3 years in the wholesale price of vegetables. The effect of lagged price on current wholesale price was positively significant and high in magnitude and significant negative response was observed for the relationship between wholesale price and market arrival for all the vegetables in the market of hill region. Therefore, improved market information system is a need of efficient vegetable markets in Nepal in order to enable farmers to make proper production and marketing decisions. Further, Government is required to create market infrastructure facilities like warehousing, processing, transportation, etc. for reducing the variation in prices of vegetables in the market of hill region of Nepal.

Objective of study were to describe the PLHAs in term of time, place and person distribution \u00a0and their socio-demographic status, to detect the mode of transmission of HIV and to recommend for \u00a0prevention of spread HIV infection and social security. Methodology: The information about socio-demographic status and exposure history of PLHAs since \u00a02010 was collected. Data were analyzed by using Epi-info software. Results: Among 329 PLHAs, 165 (50%) were men and 42 (13%) were children &lt;14 years and they \u00a0acquired HIV through blood transfusion 26 (62%). A maximum 276 (84%) PLHAs were age group 15 - \u00a045 years. Out of 25 Community Block in district, maximum PLHAs were distributed at Tamluk Block 56 \u00a0(17%) followed by Paskura 43 (13%). Of PLHAs, 246 (75%) had family income rupees &lt;2000.00 per \u00a0month and 138 (38%) of them were laborer and 85 (26%) home maker (house-wife).

CD4/ CD8 ratio has been also used for prediction of immune reconstitution infl ammatory syndrome (IRIS). The objective of the study was to determine the immunological status in HIV infected people taking anti retroviral therapy (ART) on the basis of CD4+ level and to assess the risk of development of (IRIS) on the basis of CD4+ /CD8+ ratio. Methodology: The study was carried out at Antiretroviral Therapy Centre of Seti Zonal Hospital (SZH), Dhangadi in Western region of Nepal; the second biggest ART center. The study included 760 HIV infected heterosexual, migrant laborer to India from Nepal and their spouses and children. CD profi le was enumerated by FACS Count System. Results: Out of 760, 33(5%) had normal (between1-4) CD4/CD8 ratio, 727 (95%) had abnormal ratio (less than1) of CD4/CD8. The chance of getting IRIS after ART treatment initiation in HIV infected people was 47% among which 30% found to be in high risk of getting IRIS (having CD+/CD8+ ratio less than 0.15) and 17% had chance of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in future course of treatment (having CD+/CD8+ ratio between 0.15-0.30). Conclusion: The study provides the first baseline data on CD4, CD8, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio in HIV infected people in far-western region of Nepal and will sensitize the clinician about the risk of developing IRIS during ART treatment. Furthermore no test is currently available to establish a IRIS diagnosis. Standardized disease-specific clinical criteria for common infectious manifestations of the disease should be developed.

There are of lack of data regarding the clinical profile and the steps of day to day management, hence this study aims to identify these parameters and focus on the gaps in management that is commonplace in our setting and that are representative of other resource limited settings as well.&#x0D;\nMethods: Clinical profile, etiological agents, hospital course and outcome of 30 patients with empyema thoracis treated from 2012 to 2014 in B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences was analyzed. All patients were diagnosed on the basis of aspiration of frank pus from pleural cavity.&#x0D;\nResults: 28 cases (93.3%) were Male and the mean age was 42.07\u00b118.28 years. 73.3% of the empyema was Right sided and 60% were classified as medium sized and 40% as small sized. 60% of the patients were smokers. 80% of the case were diagnosed as bacterial infection whereas 20% were presumed tubercular on clinical basis and responded to treatment. Fever was the commonest presentation in 80% of the cases followed by shortness of breath (66.7%), cough (60%), chest pain (53.3%) and sputum production (20%). On investigation, pH was not measured in the fear of clogging the ABG machine. Pleural fluid glucose was below 40 mg/dl in all the cases. The median ADA value was 54.30 (15-350) and ADA was higher than 40 U/l in 10 cases with non-tubercular empyema. All cases were managed with Chest tube insertion and antibiotics. Four patients had to be referred for BPF closure whereas five for decortications. In all cases requiring decortications, a \u201cpleural peel\u201d could be identified in Chest Xrays. Since the patients were being managed in different units the outcome of referred patients could not be ascertained.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The gaps in the management of empyema in resource limited setting starts from inappropriate early treatment, inadequate diagnostic facilities, delayed referral and lack of early and appropriate surgical intervention. All these factors combine to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with the management of Empyema thoracis.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3126/saarctb.v16i1.23242", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 27]], "date-time": "2019-03-27T16:21:51Z", "timestamp": 1553703711000}, "page": "33-37", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Clinical Profile and Management of Empyema Thoracis: Experience from Eastern Nepal"], "prefix": "10.3126", "volume": "16", "author": [{"given": "D.R.", "family": "Mishra", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "N.", "family": "Bhatta", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "P.", "family": "Koirala", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "R.H.", "family": "Ghimire", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "B.", "family": "Bista", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "N.A.", "family": "Shah", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1670", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 6, 30]]}, "container-title": ["SAARC Journal of Tuberculosis, Lung Diseases and HIV/AIDS"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/SAARCTB/article/download/23242/19737", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/SAARCTB/article/download/23242/19737", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 27]], "date-time": "2019-03-27T16:21:52Z", "timestamp": 1553703712000}, "score": 22.608994, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 6, 30]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 27]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/saarctb.v16i1.23242", "ISSN": ["2091-0959", "1818-9741"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1818-9741", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2091-0959", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 19]], "date-time": "2019-12-19T12:40:33Z", "timestamp": 1576759233122}, "reference-count": 16, "publisher": "SAGE Publications", "license": [{"URL": "http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license", "start": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 19]], "date-time": "2019-12-19T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1576713600000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "funder": [{"DOI": "10.13039/100007549", "name": "Aeronautics Research and Development Board", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "award": ["ARDB/01/2031773/M/I"]}], "content-domain": {"domain": ["journals.sagepub.com"], "crossmark-restriction": true}, "short-container-title": ["Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture"], "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawbacks of electrochemical machining can be conquered to a large extent with the introduction of electrochemical milling technique.
