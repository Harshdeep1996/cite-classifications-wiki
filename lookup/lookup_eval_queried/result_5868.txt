Cattle consumed 35% more leaf than stem fraction. Sheep consumed 21 % more leaf. When the daily voluntary intake was expressed as g/kg0.9 the intake was similar for cattle and sheep. The higher intake of the leaf fraction was associated with the shorter time that it was retained in the rumen of both cattle and sheep. Leaf and stem fractions were digested to the same extent by cattle. There was also no difference in the digestibility of leaf and stem fed to sheep. The digestive efficiency of sheep was 0.033 lower than that of cattle for both DM and NDF. Cattle retained all diets for longer periods in the rumen than did sheep. This difference was associated with the higher digestive efficiency of the cattle.

Cattle and sheep ate more of the leaf than of the stem fraction, and this was associated with the shorter time that neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was retained in the rumeno-reticulum (rumen). To study this difference, measurements were made of the retention time of lignin, passage rate of undigested NDF and water from the rumen, ruminal water volume, potential digestibility of NDF and rate of digestion of NDF by means of the nylon bag technique and in vivo techniques. Possible deficiencies of protein and minerals were minimized from this study by feeding casein and a mineral supplement. Lignin was used to measure the time that indigestible feed fractions remained in the rumen. The retention time of the NDF was closely correlated with the time lignin was retained in the rumen (r = 0.93, P &lt; 0.01). This indicated that the longer retention time and lower intake found with the stem fraction was associated with the slower rate of passage of NDF through the reticulo-omasal orifice. The longer retention time of NDF by cattle compared with sheep could also be explained in this way. The passage rate constant for water leaving the rumen was slightly higher for cattle and sheep fed on leaf fractions and lower for cattle compared to sheep on all diets. The flow of water from the rumen through the reticulo-omasal orifice was 25 and 22% (P &lt; 0.05) more for cattle and sheep respectively when they consumed leaf compared to when they consumed stem. The concentration of NDF in water passing through the reticulo-omasal orifice was similar for leaf and stem fractions (26 and 27 gl-1. There was a higher frequency of ventral ruminal sac contractions in sheep fed on leaf compared with those eating stem. The potential digestibility of the NDF was higher for leaf than stem fractions (0.658 v. 0.600, P &lt; 0.05). Rates of digestion of leaf and stem samples in nylon bags suspended in the rumen of cattle were similar. Samples that had been masticated had a higher digestion rate constant than chopped grass (0.0216 v. 0.0159, P &lt; 0.05). Digestion rate constants calculated from a rumen model showed large differences both between leaf and stem (0.0488 c. 0.0305, P &lt; 0.05) and between cattle and sheep (0.0307 v. 0.0486, P &lt; 0.05). It was suggested that the higher digestion rate constant calculated from a rumen model compared with the nylon bag method was due to additional mastication during rumination. It was concluded that the higher voluntary intake and shorter retention time in the rumen of the leaf than of the stem fraction of grasses was associated with an apparent higher rate of digestion of NDF in vivo, the higher rate of passage of the NDF from the rumen and the higher potential digestibility of the leaf. Sheep were found to retain NDF in the rumen for a shorter time than cattle, and this difference also was associated with a higher rate of digestion of the NDF and more rapid rate of passage of the NDF. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9810109", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T23:58:15Z", "timestamp": 1100735895000}, "page": "109", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 61, "title": ["Studies of cattle and sheep eating leaf and stem fractions of grasses. 2.

Particle size was determined by using a wet sieving technique, and based on the cumulative dry matter distribution on the sieves of faeces from cattle and sheep; all particles &gt;1.18 mm were described as large particles. The proportion of large particles was measured in the chopped diet offered, the masticated diet, the ruminal contents and the faeces. Chopped leaf and stem fractions contained 0.85 and 0.86 g/g large particles respectively. Mastication by cattle reduced the proportion of large particles in leaf and stem to 0.58 and 0.76 (P &lt; 0.01), and mastication by sheep to 0.56 and 0.67 (P &lt; 0.01). The proportion of large particles in the rumen of sheep was 0.236 and 0.249 for leaf and stem respectively (P &gt; 0.05) and in cattle 0.272 and 0.345 (P &lt; 0.05). The faeces contained relatively few large feed particles (&lt; 0.045 for cattle and &lt;0.018 for sheep). Cattle eating leaf and stem produced faeces containing 0.027 and 0.040 (g/g) large particles (P &lt;0.05), compared with only 0,008 and 0.013 (P &lt; 0.05) in sheep. Most of the large particles entering the rumen in the masticated feed disappeared in the rumen by breakdown to smaller particles or by digestion. In cattle the proportions that disappeared were 0.978 and 0.976 (P &gt; 0.05) for leaf and stem, and in sheep 0.993 and 0.991 (P &gt; 0.05). Large particles in leaf and stem were retained in the rumen of the sheep for 11.0 and 11.7 h (P &gt; 0.05). Cattle retained large particles in all diets for a longer time (P &lt; 0.01); 16.1 h for leaf and 20,2 h for stem (P &gt; 0.05). Differences in retention time of large particles in the rumen did not appear to be the only factor controlling the retention of dry matter in the rumen and voluntary intake. A model was developed to describe the flow of large and small particles through the rumen. Intake simulation studies indicated that the most important factor influencing dry matter retention time in the rumen was the retention time of small particles (&gt; 1.18 mm). Changes in the rate of breakdown of large particles had a small effect on dry matter retention time. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9810123", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T23:58:15Z", "timestamp": 1100735895000}, "page": "123", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 82, "title": ["Studies of cattle and sheep eating leaf and stem fractions of grasses. 3.
