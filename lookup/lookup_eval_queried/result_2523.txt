HTA impact assessment measures the influence of a HTA on decision-making and downstream to patient outcomes. Despite their potential to provide insights, the use of impact assessment frameworks by HTA agencies is limited. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of adopting HTA impact assessment frameworks is therefore important. Using a social cognitions lens, this study aims to provide insights into the enabling and hindering factors associated with the assessment of HTA impact by INAHTA members.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S0266462318000934_sec_a2-98\"><jats:title>Methods:</jats:title><jats:p>Using an interpretive description design, this cross-sectional study used semi-structured interviews of INAHTA members to gain insight into attitudes, social support, self-efficacy, barriers, and intentions towards HTA impact assessment.

Preliminary results showed that interviewees most often perceived support for assessing impact from their ministry of health or from agency staff. Most interviewees noted challenges to measuring impact at the right time and a lack of human resources, methods, and tools as internal barriers. A lack of transparency and a limited impact assessment culture were perceived as the main external barriers. Interviewees reported feeling fairly confident in overcoming internal barriers, but were less confident in overcoming external barriers. Providing feedback for improvement to HTA processes and making achievements visible were the most frequently reported advantages of assessing impact, whereas its time consuming nature was the biggest disadvantage.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S0266462318000934_sec_a4-100\"><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p>This is the first study to use a social cognitions model to understand HTA impact assessment.

In 2010, INAHTA agencies were asked to provide details on all of their HTA products. In 2013, additional information was sought on key methodological characteristics of five of the most common HTA product types. Subsequently, final agreement was sought on three proposed product types.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: Forty-five HTA agencies responded to at least one of the surveys. In 2010, twenty-one agencies reported publishing over seventy named HTA products. Core domains associated with full HTA reports were reported by a third of agencies but were labeled differently, so products were classified according to product type (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 17). Agencies producing short, tailored products increased between 2010 and 2013, with the publication of rapid reviews doubling from 33 percent to 66 percent. In 2013, half of the agencies adapted their common HTA products from documents produced by other agencies. A consensus (&gt;70 percent) was achieved on definitions for HTA reports, mini-HTAs, and rapid reviews.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: The product label for an HTA is not always indicative of its content. Terminology has, therefore, been agreed to make explicit the trade-off between rigor and timeliness in three common HTA product types. An INAHTA Product Type (IPT) Mark has been created to identify each of these. It is hoped this will further facilitate HTA adaptation between agencies and reduce duplication of effort.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1017/s0266462314000543", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 11, 14]], "date-time": "2014-11-14T23:13:04Z", "timestamp": 1416006784000}, "page": "430-437", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 15, "title": ["WHAT\u2019S IN A NAME?

Material retrieved included \nEnglish language publications between 1992 and January 1997 that reported the \nresults of prospective controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, and \nretrospective comparative studies with large series, and reviews presenting \nrisks, complications, and longer-term health consequences associated with \nIVF-ET and ICSI. No adequate prospective comparative studies of sufficient \npower on the use of IVF-ET for specific infertility diagnoses have been \nreported to date. Most of the published reports concerning results with IVF-ET \nas a treatment of infertility have been based upon small, uncontrolled \nstudies, with various methodological weaknesses. Reported results are not \ndirectly comparable. There are few follow-up data on outcomes after pregnancy \nis established or on long-term health consequences of the use of IVF-ET on \nmothers and their babies. IVF-ET has diffused widely without comprehensive \nassessment of its efficacy and safety. The available evidence supports its use \nonly for severe bilateral tubal occlusion. For other diagnoses of infertility \nthe evidence is limited and does not establish whether IVF-ET is effective. \nLong-term, well-designed, prospective clinical trials are required to \ndetermine when and for what indications IVF-ET is effective and what its \nhealth effects are on both mothers and their babies.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1017/s0266462399015172", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 27]], "date-time": "2002-07-27T13:39:16Z", "timestamp": 1027777156000}, "page": "66-85", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["THE EFFICACY AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF IN VITRO FERTILIZATION AND EMBRYO \nTRANSFER"], "prefix": "10.1017", "volume": "15", "author": [{"given": "Paula", "family": "Corabian", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "David", "family": "Hailey", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "56", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1999, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0266462399015172", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 10]], "date-time": "2019-05-10T19:21:27Z", "timestamp": 1557516087000}, "score": 30.830559, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1999, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1999, 1]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["S0266462399015172"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0266462399015172", "ISSN": ["0266-4623", "1471-6348"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0266-4623", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1471-6348", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 20]], "date-time": "2019-11-20T21:22:31Z", "timestamp": 1574284951805}, "reference-count": 93, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press (CUP)", "issue": "2", "license": [{"URL": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms", "start": {"date-parts": [[2009, 3, 10]], "date-time": "2009-03-10T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1236643200000}, "delay-in-days": 5182, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Int J Technol Assess Health Care"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstarct</jats:title><jats:p>Orthoses and prostheses include a wide range of devices and strategies for correcting and alleviating dysfunction and disability.
