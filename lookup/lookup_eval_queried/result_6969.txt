It includes an overview of agriculture in Nepal and the changes that have taken place between the early 1950s and 2007. Agricultural development has been sluggish, and has failed to keep pace with population growth. In recent years the yields of major food crops in Nepal have been lower than other South Asian countries and Nepal is now dependent on food imports. Land holding size per family and field sizes have both decreased markedly during the period. If hill regions are considered independently, all cereal crops yields have stagnated in the last 30 years and gains in production that have been made, have been due to increases in area of cultivation, at the expense of natural habitats: forests, wetlands and grasslands. Crop productivity in the hills has declined due to land degradation. Of the 28% of Nepal land that is degraded, 10% is poorly managed sloping agriculture terraces. As yields and production of cereal crops have fallen, many farmers have shifted to growing cash crops, to meet the demands of the increasing urban population and encouraged by government agricultural policies. Cultivation area, production and yields of some cash crops have significantly increased since 1964/65. Nepal\u2019s livestock population is one of the highest in Asia and nearly every rural household keeps domestic animals resulting in widespread and serious problems of livestock overgrazing. The importance of agricultural habitats for Nepal birds is reviewed: 21% of bird species recorded in Nepal utilizes agricultural habitats for foraging at some season. The many ecological benefits of birds to agriculture and the damage caused by birds to agriculture are described: the former far outweigh the latter. Changes in agricultural practices (including changes in crops and crop production, impacts of livestock overgrazing) are having major and far-reaching impacts on natural habitats - grasslands wetlands and forests and their bird species; these changes and impacts are detailed and analysed. The increasing use of pesticides in Nepal, which is especially high on vegetable cash crops, the serious impacts of pesticides on birds and the environment and alternatives to pesticides are reviewed. Fertilizer use in Nepal and the damaging impacts of fertilizer over-use on birds and the environment are also reviewed. Recommendations to improve farming methods for the benefit of the environment are given. These include government measures to promote organic agriculture; government measures to expand the System of Rice Intensification and to encourage further use of Effective Microorganisms, both of which have significant benefits for environment, birds and farmers; field surveys to monitor bird populations and bird distribution on agricultural lands, and outreach and awareness-raising for farmers to apply best practice for sustainable environmentally friendly farming.DOI: 10.3126/on.v8i1.4339</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3126/on.v8i1.4339", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 1]], "date-time": "2011-03-01T20:39:26Z", "timestamp": 1299011966000}, "page": "270-312", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Potential Impacts of Agriculture on Nepal Birds"], "prefix": "10.3126", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "C.", "family": "Inskipp", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "H.S.", "family": "Baral", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1670", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Our Nature"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/ON/article/download/4339/3655", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/ON/article/download/4339/3655", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T21:03:09Z", "timestamp": 1546030989000}, "score": 29.354784, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 2, 26]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/on.v8i1.4339", "ISSN": ["2091-2781", "1991-2951"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1991-2951", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2091-2781", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2019-11-21T02:54:23Z", "timestamp": 1574304863421}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Nepal Journals Online (JOL)", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Ecoprint"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The present work enumerates a total 26 desmids (Chlorophyta) from ponds and reservoirs in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal.

Out of them 656 were male and 628 were female. Intra-oral examination was carried out to assess occlusal types of Class I, II, III according to Angle\u2019s classification of malocclusion, and various occlusal characteristics like crowding, spacing, cross-bite, open-bite and deep bite were recorded. Gender variation in malocclusion characteristics were tested using chi-square test (p&lt;0.05).Result: The present study showed that Class I occlusion type with malocclusion was more prevalent than Class II and Class III malocclusions. Class I was seen in 71.5% , Class II div 1 in 20.7%, Class II div 2 in 3.9% cases and Class III in 4.1% cases. Among the occlusal characteristics; crowding (61.3%), deep bite (29.5%) and spacing (10.5%) were most prevalent.Conclusion: Class I malocclusion was most prevalent type of malocclusion in western Nepalese subjects.

The disease affects the rural poor socio-economical community causing significant death among untreated patients (Per capita income of Nepal US $ 400.00). An effort was made to estimate treatment cost on clinically diagnosed VL patients in three VL endemic districts of Eastern development region of Nepal.Materials &amp; Methods: During one and half year period in 2012/2013, approximately 500 cases were diagnosed as VL from three district hospitals; two zonal hospitals and one tertiary level hospital of Eastern Terai districts of Nepal. Total 172 cases were selected randomly from the three VL endemic districts of Eastern Nepal and interviewed at their homes. Results: On an average, cost for VL treatment during hospitalization was Nepali Rupees (NRS) 4032.67\u00b1313.47, where median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 17 (five to 35) days. The patients were \u00a0iagnosed symptomatically as VL after 45 \u00b1 6\u00a0days of feeling illness. The treatment cost of patient before diagnosis was NRS 2379.93 \u00b1 202.30. Patient reached the treatment center after 17 \u00b1 2 days of diagnosis and referral from community level. Total 83.7% patients came for follow-up after average 30 \u00b1 2 days of discharge with an average expense of RS 360.34 \u00b1 49.88. The death rate of VL patients during treatment and within one month of discharge was 7.6%. It was found that the average funeral cost was NRs 9598.00 \u00b1 1259.00. Conclusion: This study concludes that, average treatment cost for VL treatment during hospital stay was NRs 4032 and before treatment was around NRS 2380 and follow up cost was NRs 360. Early diagnosis and treatment in treatment center without significant delay can not only reduce the hospital stay and treatment cost, but also saves life of VL patients.JCMS Nepal. 2016;12(2):60-5</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3126/jcmsn.v12i2.15454", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 8, 29]], "date-time": "2016-08-29T11:25:40Z", "timestamp": 1472469940000}, "page": "60-65", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Treatment cost on Visceral Leishmaniasis: Case study in endemic districts of Nepal"], "prefix": "10.3126", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Dharanidhar", "family": "Baral", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1670", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 8, 29]]}, "container-title": ["Journal of College of Medical Sciences-Nepal"], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/15454/12556", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/15454/12556", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2018-12-23T11:37:45Z", "timestamp": 1545565065000}, "score": 26.343836, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 8, 29]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 8, 29]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/jcmsn.v12i2.15454", "ISSN": ["2091-0673", "2091-0657"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2091-0657", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2091-0673", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T09:21:55Z", "timestamp": 1574760115121}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Wildlife Information Liaison Development Society", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2016, 1, 26]], "date-time": "2016-01-26T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1453766400000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["J.

Some go readily for treatment, others only when in great pain and in advance state of ill health. This is especially true for people with advance age who have to face many physiological changes which act as a barrier to seek immediate help in health care setting. Thus, a study was conducted to analyse the health seeking behaviour among elderly. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 104 elderly aged 60 years and above. Non- probability convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. Data was collected by interviewing the elderly at their residence. The data gathered was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS software.
