Beranger drew the antiquities of Dublin and its neighbourhood, and then, with the French artist Angelo Bigari, sketching tours through [[Leinster]], [[Connaught]], and [[Ulster]]. Many of his drawings are accompanied by descriptions of the places and people he visited. He transferred his drawings and descriptions to manuscript volumes intended for publication, most of which were kept in Dublin, in the [[Royal Irish Academy]] and elsewhere. The drawings give the appearance of ancient buildings and stone monuments that later deteriorated or were destroyed. [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] made use of these drawings to illustrate his book on the [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s of Ireland.<ref name=""DNB""/>
