'''Malcolm Jack Blight''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 16 February 1950) is a former [[Australian rules football]]er who represented {{AFL NM}} in the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), and [[Woodville Football Club]] in the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL) during the 1970s and 1980s. He is currently serving as a coaching advisor at the [[Gold Coast Football Club]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Football Staff|url=http://www.goldcoastfc.com.au/team/football-staff/coaching-staff|website=goldcoastfc.com.au|publisher=Gold Coast Football Club|accessdate=16 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910131254/http://www.goldcoastfc.com.au/team/football-staff/coaching-staff|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

One of few players to have won the [[Brownlow Medal]] and the [[Magarey Medal]], and so far the only player to have kicked 100 goals in a season in both the VFL and the SANFL, Blight is rightly regarded as one of Australian football's greatest-ever players. In addition, he has captained the state representative sides of both [[Victoria Australian rules football team|Victoria]] and [[South Australia Australian rules football team|South Australia]].

In spite of his ""failure"" as a playing coach of North Melbourne, Blight would cement his reputation as one of the greatest coaches during his stints with {{AFL Gee}} and {{AFL Ade}}, before finishing up in an acrimonious circumstances at {{AFL StK}}. The name Blight is of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gould.com.au/Cornish-Family-Names-p/thp009.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820113233/http://www.gould.com.au/Cornish-Family-Names-p/thp009.htm |archivedate=20 August 2010 |df= }}</ref> In 2012, Blight was appointed director of coaching at the Gold Coast Football Club.

Blight was made a member of the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996 and was elevated to [[Australian Football Hall of Fame#Legends|Legend]] status (the highest honour which can be bestowed onto an Australian footballer) in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-20/australian-football-hall-of-fame-ceremony-in-adelaide/8635776|date=19 June 2017|work=ABC News|title=Australian Football Hall of Fame: Malcolm Blight becomes a legend while Simon Goodwin, Barry Hall honoured}}</ref>

==Football career==

===Woodville Football Club, SANFL===
Blight grew up supporting {{SANFL Por}} living close to [[Alberton Oval]] with his favourite player at the time being forward [[Rex Johns]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/malcolm-blight-becomes-second-sa-great-to-be-a-legend-in-the-australian-football-hall-of-fame/news-story/0e3464fabab43b07a2b52b5837445738|title=Subscribe {{!}} adelaidenow|website=www.adelaidenow.com.au|access-date=2017-06-22}}</ref> However, when a new local team [[Woodville Football Club|Woodville]] began to play in the SANFL from 1964, and Blight was now in their recruiting zone and he would make his debut for the Woodpeckers in 1969. Blight had a break-out year in 1972 when he won Woodville's [[best and fairest]] award as well as the SANFL's highest individual honor, the [[Magarey Medal]], bringing him to the attention of the VFL.

After his stint in the VFL, Blight returned to Woodville, serving as captain-coach from 1983 to 1985 before continuing as non-playing coach in 1986 and 1987. He was club best and fairest in 1983 and in his last season of playing football (1985) topped the league goalkicking list with 126 goals.<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/SAToC_half_forwards.htm SA Team of the Century: Left Half Forward Flank – Malcolm Blight]</ref>

===North Melbourne Football Club, VFL===
Blight was recruited by the [[North Melbourne Football Club|Kangaroos]] and, although he was reluctant to join at first, he went on to play 178 games for the club between 1974 and 1982.<ref>[http://kangaroos.com.au/kangaroosfc/Kangas/TheClub/History/HallofFame/tabid/4989/Default.aspx North Melbourne Football Club: Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910033501/http://www.kangaroos.com.au/kangaroosfc/Kangas/TheClub/History/HallofFame/tabid/4989/Default.aspx |date=10 September 2007 }}</ref> He was a member of the Kangaroos' premiership sides in [[1975 VFL Grand Final|1975]] and [[1977 VFL season|1977]], and in [[1978 VFL season|1978]] won both the [[Brownlow Medal]] and the [[Syd Barker Medal]] for being the [[best and fairest]] player in the VFL and for North Melbourne respectively.

Blight was consistently one of the most brilliant players in the VFL during the 1970s. Besides taking spectacular [[Mark (Australian football)|marks]], he was also a prolific goalkicker, renowned for his ability to kick the [[torpedo punt]]. In [[1982 VFL season|1982]], Blight won the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading the VFL in goalkicking, and led the Kangaroos' goalkicking four times during his career.

}}
In a moment that has since passed into Australian rules football folklore, in 1976 Blight kicked a famous [[After the siren kicks in Australian rules football|goal after the siren]] against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in Round 10 (5 June). After kicking two goals in time-on in the last quarter, Blight [[Mark (Australian football)|marked]] an estimated 80 metres from the goals. [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] were still trailing by one point – only a goal would win the game. Many assumed Blight's effort would be futile and spectators were already exiting the playing arena. However, Blight kicked one of the biggest-ever [[torpedo punt]]s, with the ball going over the goals but between the posts to an improbable victory for the Kangaroos. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXwTvbgmkEA#t=43 YouTube video])

This moment was the focus of a television commercial in the [[Toyota Legendary Moments]] series which featured Blight. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmC-La-BNlE YouTube video])

====Infamous moments====

During the [[1977 VFL season]], which happened to be played during the wettest Melbourne winter in 40 years, {{AFL NM}} hosted {{AFL Haw}} at [[Arden Street Oval|Arden Street]]. The ground conditions were atrocious, and the match for the most part resembled something more akin to mud wrestling. Hawthorn led by one point when Blight was given a free kick and a set shot for goal. He scored a behind, which would have levelled the scores, but was given a second attempt after the umpire penalized Hawthorn for an infringement. Unfortunately for Blight and North Melbourne, the ball slew off the side of his boot and went out of bounds on the full, giving the Hawks victory.

In [[1981 VFL season|1981]], while still serving as playing coach, Blight made one of the most bizarre blunders ever seen in a football match. In North Melbourne's Round 14 clash against {{AFL Ric}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]], Blight was on the end of a chain of handpasses deep in the forward zone. He seemed certain to score a goal as he ran into the goal square, only to run past the goal posts and kick the ball through the behinds. As he said after the match when he realised his mistake: ""I've never done that before. I'm probably going barmy.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=malcolm+blight&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=AGE0107205G7J0069N8A|title=Going Balmy – SPORTING LIFE|editor=McClure, Geoff|date=20 July 2001|work=[[The Age]]}}</ref> Richmond won that match by 43 points, and Blight was sacked as playing coach less than a month later.

Blight was indirectly involved in another infamous football incident during the [[1980 Escort Championships|1980 Escort Cup]] grand final against [[Collingwood Magpies|Collingwood]], held at [[VFL Park]], Waverley. Blight kicked the ball to [[Kerry Good]] as the siren sounded. However, the umpire did not hear the siren and awarded the mark to Good who kicked the winning goal to win in controversial circumstances.

==Coaching and after coaching==
Blight later became a successful coach famous for employing unorthodox, and at times controversial, coaching methods as attempts to motivate his players.<ref name=stopping>{{cite web| url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/26/1053801337715.html |title = Stopping the rot | accessdate = 2009-01-18 | date = 2003-05-27 |work=[[The Age]]}}</ref>

===Playing coach at North Melbourne===
Appointed playing coach in 1981 after [[Ron Barassi]] departed, Blight was sacked as coach after six consecutive losses.<ref>[http://www.australianrules.com.au/2004stories/top10sacked.html Australianrules.com: The 10 biggest mid-season coaching upheavals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050617033649/http://australianrules.com.au/2004stories/top10sacked.html |date=17 June 2005 }}</ref> The following week he rebounded with a club-record 11 goal haul against [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]], at the Western Oval. Once again, Blight's inaccurate kicking for goal may have prevented him from kicking a club record of a possible 16 to 17 goals. Blight's total as playing coach ([[Wayne Schimmelbusch]] was captain) was 16 games (6 wins, 10 losses) and the last of the playing Coaches in the VFL.

===Back at Woodville===
Playing coach 1983 to 1985, continued as non-playing coach to 1987. His tenure as coach coincided with the clubs most successful season (1986) in the entire history of the Woodville Football Club, when they reached the Preliminary Final.<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Woodville.htm Fullpointsfooty.net: Woodville Football Club]</ref> During the season the Warriors (who had changed from being known as the Woodpeckers to the Warriors in 1983) had defeated their hated ""big brother"" Port Adelaide once during the minor round at [[Woodville Oval]] (drawing the oval's ground record attendance of 11,026 to their Round 18 clash), and also in the First Semi-final at [[Football Park]], before going down to eventual premiers [[Glenelg Tigers|Glenelg]] in the Preliminary Final.

===Geelong and Adelaide: A reputation is forged===
Senior coach from [[1989 VFL season|1989]] to [[1994 AFL season|1994]], highlighted by Grand Final appearances in [[1989 VFL Grand Final|1989]], 1992 and 1994. Total of 145 games, 89 wins, 56 losses. One of the strangest incidents as a coach of Geelong was his extroverted decision to stand on a metal box to watch the game against the West Coast Eagles in Perth. His excitement of ""seeing the game at ground level"", was an attempt to get back to basics and some nostalgia.

Blight's arrival at the Crows at the end of the 1996 season was marked with dramatic effect, with the delisting of four ageing club stalwarts [[Anthony ""Tony"" McGuinness|Tony McGuinness]], [[Chris McDermott]], [[Andrew Jarman]], and [[Greg Anderson (footballer)|Greg Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20521838-21543,00.html|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|title=Head rules heart}}</ref> This attracted great criticism at the time, but Blight was vindicated by winning the [[List of Australian Football League premiers|AFL premiership]] in 1997, and again in 1998. He retired as coach at the end of the 1999 season after an unsuccessful year finishing 13th. To commemorate his legacy as Adelaide's first premiership coach, the club named their annual best and fairest award the [[Malcolm Blight Medal]].

===St Kilda: Promising start, disappointing end===
After finishing at Adelaide, Blight decided to retire from football and moved to Queensland. St. Kilda officials visited him there during 2000 and overcame his reluctance to coach St Kilda in 2001 with a $1 million offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/st-kilda/andrew-thompson-on-how-the-saints-wooed-malcolm-blight-as-coach/news-story/27d4e7860d9484a0c669d5e2a2e15f17|work=[[Herald Sun]]|title=Andrew Thompson on how the Saints wooed Malcolm Blight as coach|date=21 May 2017|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> Blight was sacked after Round 15 (3 wins, 12 losses). His famous humiliation of the players by making them stay on Colonial Stadium after a Round 10 loss to Melbourne highlighted the worsening relation between the coach, players and club supporters. Some years later the former president of St Kilda, [[Rod Butterss]], questioned Blight's commitment to the club during his tenure. Blight responded memorably from his position as media commentator with Channel Ten, saying: 
{{quote|I couldn't give a rat's tossbag whether he thought I could coach or whether anyone thinks I can coach or can play. But when he talked about commitment for St Kilda, for the time I was there, it was absolute garbage made by a very naive person.|Malcolm Blight|[http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/blights-passion-burns-furiously/2009/07/21/1247941916376.html Out of left-field, Blight's passion burns furiously]}}
However, as early as February 2003, Butterss had admitted that his appointment of Blight as coach was ""an error.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/24/1046063964928.html|work=[[The Age]]|title=Butterss admits: We haven't delivered|date=25 February 2003|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> In August 2017, Butterss further admitted that he'd made crucial decisions (including the Blight saga) while under the influence of drugs and alcohol during his tenure at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/au/afl/news/rod-butterss-made-decisions-as-st-kilda-president-on-drugs-and-alcohol/bphjp61lt7j11g23vr1gixoas|work=[[Sporting News Media]]|title=Rod Butterss made decisions as St Kilda president while high, drunk|date=17 August 2017|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref>

===Involvement at Gold Coast===
Blight joined the 17th AFL team, Gold Coast, as a board member.

In July 2012, Gold Coast announced that Blight had stepped down from the board to take up a part-time advisory role to Gold Coast coach [[Guy McKenna]], following a similar growing trend where former coaches (among them [[Mark Williams (Australian footballer born 1958)|Mark Williams]], [[Dean Laidley]] and [[Mark Harvey]]) have been employed as advisors to other head coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/blight-borrow-wisdom-of-elders/story-fn83zfxo-1226419871410|title=Blight: Borrow wisdom of elders|work=[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]|date=7 July 2012}}</ref>

===Blight's Squad of Champions===
Looking back over his coaching career, Blight nominated in June 2012 a team of the greatest 22 players that he had coached, plus four emergencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/my-squad-of-champions/story-fncw5ppl-1226391006372|last=Blight|first=Malcolm|title=Selecting my squad of champions|work=[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]|date=9 June 2012}}</ref> This was how the team looked:

The four emergencies named were: [[Peter Caven]] (Adelaide), [[Kane Johnson]] (Adelaide), [[Peter Riccardi]] (Geelong) and [[Tony Modra]] (Adelaide).

==Media career==
Blight continued his football involvement through the media. He commentated for the [[Seven Network]] during his hiatus from coaching in 1995 and 1996 and also co-hosted ''[[Talking Footy]]'' with fellow commentator [[Bruce McAvaney]] and journalist [[Mike Sheahan]]. He was one of the commentators at [[Waverley Park]] during the famous ""Lights Out Incident"" during a night match between {{AFL Ess}} and {{AFL StK}} in [[1996 AFL season|1996]]. After finishing up as a coach, Blight commentated for [[Network Ten]]'s television coverage.

In 2006 Blight appeared in a Toyota Legendary Moment ad recreating his goal after the siren against Carlton.

He also wrote football-related articles for the ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]''.

Blight is known for his dislike of the practice of players using [[grubber kick]]s when attempting to score a goal, due to the lack of control and unpredictability of the bounce.<ref name=""ban"">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/afl-legend-malcolm-blight-urges-coaches-to-ban-players-from-performing-the-grubber-kick-for-goal/story-e6frf3e3-1226411827163|title=AFL legend Malcolm Blight urges coaches to ban players from performing the 'grubber' kick for goal|last=Milbank|first=Zac|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=29 June 2012}}</ref>
