He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.\n\nThe French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work \'\'[[What is Property?]]\'\', published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.<ref>Daniel Guerin, \'\'Anarchism: From Theory to Practice\'\' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).</ref> He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In \'\'What is Property?\'\', Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "[[Property is theft]]". In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" (\'\'propri??t??\'\'), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.<ref name="proudhon-prop">Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. \'\'"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3.

The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included [[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers ([[??lie Reclus]] and [[??lis??e Reclus]]) and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune\'s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune\'s vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin\'s and Proudhon\'s ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|title=The Paris Commune|work=blackened.net|accessdate=30 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625232340/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|archivedate=25 June 2012}}</ref> George Woodcock states that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elis??e Reclus and Louise Michel".<ref name="Anarchism 1962"/>\n\n=== Organised labour ===\n{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism|International Workers\' Association|Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Revolution of 1936}}\nThe [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] sections of the First International were the precursors of the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labour".<ref>Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in \'\'Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas\'\', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]</ref> In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.<ref name=foner/>\n\n[[File:ChicagoAnarchists.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A sympathetic engraving by [[Walter Crane]] of the executed anarchists of Chicago after the [[Haymarket affair]], which is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international [[International Workers\' Day|May Day]] observances]]\nIn response, unions across the United States prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.<ref name=foner/> On 3 May, a fight broke out in Chicago when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.<ref>{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=[[The Haymarket Tragedy]] |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}</ref> The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago\'s Haymarket Square.<ref>{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=[[The Haymarket Tragedy]] |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}</ref> A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.
